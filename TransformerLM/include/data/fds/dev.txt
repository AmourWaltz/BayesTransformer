they would be the plows would be on the streets and they would salt and sand and you know it would then the next morning it would be fine
well western new york is suppose to be use to this kind of weather but
here they start even forecast the weather you know it's gonna be an ice storm tomorrow
in um anaheim california you know just
boy they sound nice well i don't think i've ever seen wooden plates at any of the craft shows
and uh you know this uh couldn't catch his breath even in his sleep and that turned me off of day cares
yeah
and it's a real challenge to find foods proper foods to eat and
uh it's out of new york it's a pretty famous restaurant out of new york and almost every single recipe in there is um vegetarian there are some fish recipes i think in it but a few of those but not anything
i have a
yeah
let's see i've i've i've never done this before i mean i've never [noise]
yeah
i._b._m. says let's throw it away leading edge will say we'll buy it from you
no no i go to the it's the naval postgraduate school out here
um-hum
[noise]
yeah
you you can have an extra five days off and be paid for them at the time you know you- you're really not being paid for them the money is actually coming out of your own pocket but it's coming out a little bit at a time instead of all at once you know
that delays it for a few years just right off the bat
[noise]
but still i would hate to be on the jury that sentenced someone
well you know that brings up the interesting subject too you know what would you have who who who would determine what these people do
i think that would be real interesting for people to do but i guess my concern about that would be the cost involved trying to train people in a new language and ship them you know to other countries and
yeah
[noise]
it is for me other people don't seem to have the same problem [laughter]
well that's that's a big one in my book but uh um
[laughter] that's the hard part right
an- and we did aerobics together for about a month and a half and that went over real well but uh that's about it there
the pressure that lobbyists can put
yeah there's uh a lot of extremes on the parties too with the you know the real uh far side of the democrats they're real liberal now to where probably fifty or a hundred years ago um
[laughter]
[noise] uh-huh [vocalized-noise]
huh
every once in a while i- i like to go on the nights when there's not anybody out there not very many people out there it's a lot more fun when you're not fighting a crowd
or working in the system
i don't have the patience to read [laughter]
so i would um
uh-huh
what do you know about timber framing
and east and well see we have a little knoll on our property about thirty feet tall and it's almost straight up so we'll nestle the house right up next to it
i think it's five and i think we have [laughter]
yeah i just love that place i've gone there twice
yeah
i can imagine [laughter]
you can't say yep
what did you get your degree in
hum
but the two are mutually exclusive
so we even we just were recently married so we have a stir fry pan sort of like a big wok
your conversation
and then you hear the chicken jumping around under the tub and finally it dies down get just a little patter and then it
with some reward that was higher which would
you know self uh
but yeah so i'm kind of limited now to [vocalized-noise] going back to my old farm pond
pushing a mastercard that you know they're supposed to spend so much of the money on on conservation measures and stuff
yeah
yeah
um-hum
[laughter]
i don't know i've only done this one other time and i thought that the man told me five minutes so
maybe that's a a change because sometimes taking care of a house depending on uh
so the thing is is basically that i spend like maybe thirty five forty dollars every two weeks on on groceries and that's about it
but um
several credit cards that sometimes uh
yeah
what else did i get in there and jalapeno peppers
exactly yeah right
yeah
i don't know i- i think in in some in some respects it
yeah if they do come up with a positive regardless of what uh what it was they detected
okay yeah there aren't just too many places uh that do testing like that where the government uh uh gives well
you know it's just a hangover i guess from uh from that particular generation
uh-huh
yes nice to have spoken with you too bye-bye
okay well my favorite probably all time t._v. show is star trek
that's mission impossible
yeah yeah
absolutely
last year i was kind of [noise] thinking he sure did get in a slump but they're saying this year their predictions is that he's really gonna come out of it and be on top
absolutely
oh my gosh
have you seen those uh do you ever read cosmo
oh no
right i'm so glad my husband is a cat person because if he was a dog person no it wouldn't have worked [laughter]
i mean it it's it's got some areas that are really nice but i mean you get up there and everything is just you know you know souvenirs and all this kind of junk
yeah i uh uh i've been mainly with groups of people and uh sometimes with a family here and there a couple of families get together but mainly it college age kids and
yes and the
oh
um-hum
i don't know no i don't
it's between texas and louisiana
um-hum
yep
which is really really sad
we have
he's good he's he's talented boy he is
okay me too
um-hum
all right well that's that's a neat deal
they spent an awful lot of money on him too a million and a half dollars for a one year contract [noise]
i'm sure he will he's not going to have problems there if not in the n._f._l. then in one of the other leagues
yeah
yeah
hm
but i have some question whether or not they will ever really get around to that i think we'll have a black president b- before we have a woman president
i can't remember where i i read that recently somewhere and i can't remember where but i thought it was up there [noise] so that's interesting because new hampshire
how about you
um-hum
and so the whole page you you never can actually see it you just draw it and they have to zoom out and zoom in and you know it's like every time that you have to do something is it's really a pain
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
[laughter]
it's nice and dark and quiet so it just kind of depends on the occasion
noodles and pasta and such
oh that doesn't that sounds good
a water ski trip or uh fishing trip or just a sightseeing bird watching you know hunt hunt with a camera type of thing or there's a lot of different opportunities for things like that it's a lot of fun it really is
they can go ahead and use it then or they can just wait the full year and then have two
so uh
um and uh i i gosh this uh this whole thing now with all the uh
it's interesting i i'm i'm looking forward to seeing what happens over there in the next couple of months but uh that's
however uh every time an organization such as the p._l._o. says well we'll see if we can work with israel
yeah
that's where i learned about
yeah oh yeah i've i've done i've done that at church too haven't done that in a long time [noise]
um-hum well those things were big and thick weren't they
they just do a urine test which i think they should do a a blood test because then that tells them that you know they testing for [noise] drugs but i think
[noise]
and it's all prescription it's fine but what kind of drug is it
yeah
yeah
well it was good talking to you betty have a good night
um-hum
um-hum
so
[laughter]
oh i-
uh silence of the lambs yeah i didn't really care for her her earlier films uh taxi driver or the accused and i was kind of wondering if this was uh a little different style
uh i thought it was just kind of like a spoiled brat staying at home and causing a lot of trouble
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
[noise]
um i know that there are young people
yeah i think it made about three minutes on one of the national news stations or something and and we've been in a state of emergency for over you know for ten or eleven days you know we just got our phone back today uh
yeah it sounds pretty good [laughter] that sounds good i've noticed a lot of uh [noise] different organizations in our community uh
i can't so [laughter]
she you know she killed him but she lost her baby and then they sent her to jail so that's not right
they use the the injection thing or whatever it is
um
yeah [noise]
and i have three what do you have boys girls
exac-
bye-bye
uh-huh
nice talking to you irene and you stay warm up there
oh it it would be wonderful
and it was very uh very much in demand for a career
tried to have fun being in the band was about the only entertainment i had
but on the nightly news now he goes into his commentary and that's where i get get into the problem with with him i frequently disagree with his commentaries
once a week
oh i'm with you i have to check t. news every everyday
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
thirty day notice for what
in fact the cowboys got the best end of that deal
hello hello did i reach the dallas area
and so the thing is you know is like i asked a guy you know why why do you wear that he goes well it costs me the same amount which is true because some dress pants you know cost me twenty five dollars which is the same as jeans
uh-huh
and and while i was gone this change to people wearing ties and jackets came about because when i came back i saw ties and jackets in t._i. for the first time
okay
right [laughter]
uh-huh
[noise]
y- you have exceeded your ten minutes time limit hang up within the next thirty seconds so
is that right
yeah mine me too and i ha-
i bet
uh masterpiece theatre is really good
yeah yeah
now see i agree with that i- i don't think a person should be electrocuted or
you know it wasn't like she
to uh kill another mother
and uh there wasn't a thing they could do you know they'd take her down to the juvenile hall and then they'd have to let her go and she'd be back [laughter] doing it
but you can just snack on it
you barbecue steaks
oh
uh-huh yeah yeah i i hardly ever give the people a second try if if somebody's rude to me or
[laughter]
hum
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
uh
yeah and he blames all of his uh tax problems on his elementary school wife
[laughter]
yes that w-
that's right and and all these other people and out running around i i guess that's the only problem with jobs is being relatively scarce so
that's i agree yeah and it
[vocalized-noise]
i but i see that and god's really shown me that and i don't talk to them i don't try and witness to them don't try and convert them i just say you can you can ei- you can come back when my husband's here
it you know the people who do it
yeah i- i i don't
i don't either i was i almost hung up because i thought well gosh i don't i don't really have an opinion except for no i think that's dumb
not a whole lot
well that's good we
it'd seem like they'd want to just to uh get some shade and keep their houses a little bit cooler in the summer
yeah yeah as as long as you give it uh good drainage and uh lot of uh oh [laughter] some some plant food once a month
you'd think that that would be the first thing they would do as far as the yard goes is to plant a tree
uh-huh
yeah i haven't watched johnny carson in a long time i used to watch that and i used to watch david letterman and things like that in college and love connection that was one of my favorite ones in college because we'd get up in the in the apartment
yeah i was going to say i haven't seen the past couple episodes i think the last one i really saw was when he broke up with christine
uh-huh
well we get the same things trees being uprooted limbs falling all over the place power lines getting
oh yeah it was it was utterly amazing i mean we we would um we got up in the morning you know um we didn't we yo- yo- you didn't sleep very well because ev- all all around you there were crashing sounds and
you know when when when you get twenty five cold days a year rather than twenty five warm days a year
clear out our basement and we would like do just even stupid things like we try hurtling our couches and stuff
and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids
my my husband's mother came from a family of thirteen but i mean that's his mother you know and and they're catholic and and i mean that's
yeah
so you can do it relatively quickly
oh yes um let's see we've got a
does it work for leaves
that was rather um gross [laughter]
oh i thought it was great yeah
yeah
they're eight and ten
well how about kindergarten cop
alrighty bye-bye
[noise]
yeah [vocalized-noise]
yeah
on a jury that was uh a change of venue from columbus ohio for aggravated uh murder and kidnapping
uh-huh bye-bye
well the the problem i had with the movie was the problem i've had with a lot of uh i guess hollywood movies which is you know it's a formula movie and they're making the movie according to a certain formula that's a good formula but they seem to
[vocalized-noise] united you can succeed individually you will fail and then there was a big climactic fight scene and they didn't remember that
oh shoot i'm going to hit myself after i hang up i'll remember the name
uh-huh
right
y- you kind of perpetuate that
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
which i thought was interesting
but i'm glad it's done because it's brighter
well we uh i just got married about six months ago and we bought a house at the same time so we're i'm sitting here in my forty year old house and we're about halfway through the painting process
i'm i'm starting to learn that there's always something else so that you could [laughter] once you get done you can always start over and and you can make up all kinds of excuses so uh
i don't see it in the near future
they they do have a lot of uh tax benefits
but as you say it's two di- two different cultures
yeah you probably get this probably pretty sticky after you get done then you've got to drain the water out of the watermelon because you know when you scrape it it makes the water
that's what kind of fondue the cheese dip or
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah yeah i uh was uh you know where they were all concerned about that but that that it seems to be
no i'm actually in the south building but uh
well that they talked nuclear winner and and i suppose that's that's the ultimate uh pollution problem
oh really
[laughter] tried it on and decided i really did not like how it looked on me
[laughter]
i don't know that i'm i guess i'm ready just hard to see a woman in such a
i don't know
what do you think about uh about our new governor since she happens to be a female
uh-huh
well i think what i see is a different direction i don't know if you are you familiar with uh programs like harvard graphics where they have uh
that
yes i have
uh and everyone wanted to go home and so they were willing some of them were willing to change their uh decision just to get out of uh out of the jury room
j- close just right and uh things of that nature
oh [laughter]
um-hum um-hum
i mean i see people at supposedly really good universities who are just having such psychological problems that you think this isn't sinking in
uh-huh
i work in a in a labora- an air force laboratory and so we've got a lot of uh
who from when he was a little kid like ten years old
uh-huh
yeah it was i really liked it my wife and i loved it yeah
so that's uh because he has a pretty strong will and he directs his own way so it should be you know pretty good
yeah see we're a little bit later than that but that's right that's about right about the same yeah
oh yeah
seeing what died
[laughter]
a lot of people have ended up going uh to treatment you know which is offered i think at most government places i know it is at t._i. do you work for t._i.
so i guess i don't know what just old age i guess is why i [laughter]
i mean i- i work for t._i. so i don't do drugs you know
okay you tested positive now explain yourself and i could say yeah well i was around some people that were smoking pot but i wasn't but you know it's the idea that
um-hum
yeah it just doesn't stop
yep
yeah
because he wasn't really paying attention to business you know
it's just great up there
uh-huh
yeah but it's hard to make it being a rancher or farmer
yeah
people murdering other people they know mostly people they know
[laughter]
garland daily news i guess it's it comes out sporadically like twice a week or some- but i think what's interesting is that if you're that there uh this
sure
well
was it snow- snowing
burn up and so forth that's happened to quite a few of my plants
okay so we're in garland
yeah
yeah
to start like a couple of thousand dollars but there should be a limit over which they that it all goes back to the state anything that they've earned while they're in prison
yeah
yeah that's true uh my favorite team is are is are the raiders
uh-huh
[noise]
uh-huh
i thought i thought for sure that buffalo was going to be in there this past year i really did and i w- that would be my choice that would be my choice again this year
well steve it's been nice talking with you
th- exactly and and yeah they never they never did things to embarrass the town and that's what i think would be would be bad about new england
good that's great to hear uh and christian literature uh i've kind of i used to read a lot of uh novels
uh-huh that's right
five
yeah
[noise]
somebody told me like that like you can watch baseball and the actual play time that there is is five minutes
it's like oh man
bye
um-hum
nickels but do you think there's accounting on an ordered of magnitude or that
it will protect that maybe we have learned a little bit of a lesson here about what happens if you remove a little of the regulation
okay which uh shows do you watch on t._v.
yeah
and so they've chosen not to participate in it
yeah
hum boy that makes the governor's vote a whole lot more important doesn't it
yes
because if they turn around they can get away they get away with it and they get away with it and they get away with it and then they do something worse and they get a slap on the wrist they get thirty days in jail and they finally get up to where they kill somebody else and they go through fourteen appeals and
[noise]
um-hum
i think the the significant thing is is today did did you uh did you see barbara walters interview with schwartzkopf
especially in the minority n- neighborhoods
if you understand what i mean
they have very specific programs that um
i w- would i would agree with you and uh
the systems that we pay taxes to support and all of that makes us feel bad but i think you know all in all how i feel is that um i'm willing to pay the taxes because
we were kind of in for a rude awakening they had personal property taxes on like cars and the first year we're there it was like eight hundred dollars and we're like
you know i could
[laughter]
you know what i'm saying i think we're loaning money to too many nations
oh really
i've always had that hobby ever since i was a child
well there are some uh good opportunities for that in the british virgins
but
and we have we have hills i'm afraid of the hills [laughter] but i'm getting on to it i just pretend they're not there and i just go ahead and do it [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh we have some people that have done their lawns an- and uh
all right
oh i see
hum
yeah that's fine go ahead
oh that's wonderful
and to um i don't know maybe people give give p- give young people an appreciation for maybe what they have and what other people don't have
i designed and built my own home about twelve years ago
[laughter]
but uh those overhangs and things do have to be painted you know every four or five years and i bought a uh a power roller
yeah
i know right where that's at
i mean the whole way
yeah it is it's it's solid limestone
oh okay
i've got a big oldsmobile that i pull it with when i
yes exactly
never done anything with them i still got still got them in a box
because you have to you have to show they knowingly did it
and uh a um a nineteen eleven which is fairly scarce
oh
oh it sounds good
you cook them so often you kind of forget their names yeah yeah
um-hum of course i mean it's got its bad side so it's limited by the format and obviously you don't get into court as quickly as they seem to make it out that you do i mean
i mean
yeah i watch that occasionally when
oh yeah i wat- oh i like c. i like c._n._n.'s new uh news coverage better than anybody's
oh yeah
yeah
back so severely um at least in california where i am where there's a very severe budget crisis because of agriculture was wiped out last year and um a number of other things and uh
which is uh uh a propaganda phrase used a lot against exactly such types of spending programs and um
because you no longer can think that fast anyway
yeah of course needs and wants aren't necessarily the same thing
uh-huh
well have you done much camping up in kentucky and and those parts in the mountains
so we have we leave three little piles of things out on the curb every thursday and the garbage men come by and
well those things must take up a huge amount of space in landfills
right yes and then the plus the time that you waste standing in line is valuable also
[vocalized-noise]
obviously is the cost of health care as you know it's just going completely out of sight
you know i mean some sometimes i feel like maybe some of them are just kind of pressured or not really into you know and
gosh
i guess it's too frustrating [laughter]
and that was the whole idea of why they had so many buffers and maybe you know more and more people are seeing or countries hopefully are seeing that
well th- the china situation you know the when it looked like that thing was was turning around and then all of the sudden it was like somebody in the
nut i'm trying to think back now i read an awful lot of uh
yeah
and it's uh god i don't know if i would call it
[laughter] is that a big thick book
very trendy resort type town but the my wife lived in annapolis for a short time and uh she really liked this one restaurant it was it's french
i do too
um-hum um-hum
[noise]
oh yeah well [laughter] they're they're just
uh-huh
oh was he
um-hum
um-hum
well i- i used to babysit for this family that didn't have a t._v. and their their kids turned out fine
from the day care
you know
that that's going to mean that we're going to be involved from now on and so any war that breaks out we're going to have to be in the middle of it
i think uh basically what we're going to have to do is now that bush has made the made the stand is what we'll have to continue to uh stick up for our foreign policy if we don't then what's going to happen is that everybody well it's just a one time shot they're not going to do anything
and of course now's the time to do it because since we have the army over there i'd sure hate to you know spend eight months pulling them out and then turn right around send them back over again
well if you've been here for three years you didn't get here the year they had the big freeze and stuff here did you what was that eighty eighty four
yeah it just got the the name of being an oak because it's got a kind of an acorn kind of thing on it
yeah yeah
right
i was not aware aware of that
[laughter] all right
right
you just you just managed to escape the real texan accent i thought maybe you had come from somewhere else and had some experience with taxes there
that's what you do huh and demos four
are so protecting what they have in the budget that it doesn't seem to work that every man has to pay his own fair share and maybe that's why corporate america gets away with what they're doing
i never put anything beyond
you sound very young are you a young person
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh well i'm in pennsylvania
they've had longer hunting seasons than that up here even to get rid of more of them because they were uh increasing so much
if it rained we were stuck back in there had a four wheel drive so we could
and you know we're recycling aluminum cans up here and uh you know just what you'd buy out of the machines and drink here and there's crushers out in all of the hallways you know and they're and that's and they use the money from that to fund this
i mean let's face it to- today's uh means of communications we could uh very well a newscaster could very well give aw- away a
yeah but you need to continue to read so you you can people learn to read you know
[noise]
i i'm kind of i'm i'm about two hours north of pittsburgh
and she has mace you know even to carry like i'm i'm at college so
i don't think that's going to hurt anything
yeah
so i had i had always been a a sea fisher type which is a lot of fun
you went to galveston uh
lake fork i i can't remember but he said it's one of the best bass fishing places
yeah we went swimming one time in the whole week that we were there and the rest of the time we stayed in the pool
uh extreme south part where there's some some things worth seeing by foot uh the majority of of camping experiences around here seem to be geared toward entertainment where you're you're looking at the state parks all seem to have something of a
uh-huh the uh yeah i've
well that's
um-hum
ooh my it's got to be something fun yeah you don't have to think yeah sure
[noise]
[noise] well i mean it's it's no disgrace to lose in the final four
yeah
yeah
but i wouldn't sleep on the ground i went into a hotel [laughter] but i used to take the kids to uh you know the things like uh the places where there are animals and you go in and and feed the animals and things like that and uh
i don't think i uh i would have to say i probably didn't get to spend as much time as i would have liked to either uh however i did you know uh
[laughter] my oldest yeah my oldest daughter is hard headed as can be
um-hum um-hum
you know that's something that's something fairly new and not a lot of people take advantage of it but it's you know it's use it or lose it and i
um-hum well but see i read an article about uh in t._v. guide about uh about hunter and about his l- you know latest you know his three girls whatever you want to call them
so hum
right
which is really international and and it keeps reminding me you know that this w- we're really in an in an iso- different situation here and i keep saying no wonder the rest of the people in the world vote for in the country vote the way they do i mean
do you uh normally read the newspaper every day
yeah
yeah
we buried her february but she had been in there at least i know f-
[laughter]
no not really they they were they were pretty much thugs they weren't scared of very much you know [laughter]
they've been young for a while and they're alm- almost starting to age a little bit here i just um yeah they they're they're really hurting pitching wise i mean they've got ryan but you know who knows
right that was year they beat houston in extra innings and then and then they actually won the series by
well the way i the way i see it is i mean um you know i i can use a met analogy here
right well it's it's a beautiful city and but the problem is like first example when i was young they they took me to las vegas and that was the most boring place on earth [vocalized-noise]
oh uh-huh
uh-huh yeah uh i agree with you very much so now we waited several years before we started having children because we was still in college and we knew
that's right it's too cold up there
yeah i- i know what you mean because uh because you got to have like little oil heaters where they plug in the uh plug in uh your car
and it is re- really good about the um saudis and just tracking their families and the arabian culture
yeah
you know and i
to the rest of uh the population or or you can put them out of everybody's misery uh i don't know it's it's a real moral dilemma
yeah
oh we i've always had crude ones at my father's but this is the first time that i really have to landscape a house his house is more like a farmhouse its not on a main road
yeah i don't i don't i just don't think you i always thought i'd put a tomato plant in there or something weird but i don't think i could really eat the fruit off it without wondering
yeah i guess i was having a hard time there too i thought it sounded well
uh-huh
he doesn't e- [laughter]
it doesn't it's they have far too much influence over there and they're so unstable that it makes it hard for um
yeah i'm in dallas i didn't know that people from other parts of the country were doing this
yes they're very bold it seems
uh-huh
no i i'm uh single i'm uh
was you know there's fairly big dis- discrepancies you know so they could try to replace those so i got involved uh on that end
is [vocalized-noise] the hospitalization medical care benefits is what we like the best um because it's a good well rounded program it's you know just eighty percent and then uh the deductible's reasonable
so have you b- have you been just been out of school what i guess four years yeah
oh yeah
um i've yeah i've been involved with uh some of the campaigns and the state conventions of the
[noise]
well budgeting is a sore subject in this family
no
and uh um yeah and they understand our eh the pro- our process [vocalized-noise]
yeah
and throw it out the at the and at uh
either again bottom fishing or for grouper or i used to catch you know i've caught a few
[laughter] they just they just look as though you do not want to do anything with them [laughter]
everybody but you [laughter]
um-hum
large inner city school districts
um-hum
felt like he liked the people that he would be working with and that there would be some uh opportunity for
oh yes you're not kidding
uh-huh
you know i mean it's not uh i don't think dallas is considered uh a a real bad
you know as far as as far as
uh the bottom line that i after four years of working with the state prison system i've come to the conclusion if you're going to give the man the death sentence
uh-huh
oh
yeah
right
so he s- says want me to pull the back off i says no and so he pulled them off anyway [laughter]
i'm in the uh t._i. f-
and uh driving at that time i had this uh little ford escort
uh red facedly i must admit that i didn't
[noise]
nice talking with you
no they're just not they're not prepared for it
yeah it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere
but we don't you know live in a brand new house either maybe an eighty ninety hundred thousand dollar house we live in a thirty year old house that would probably sell for forty five thousand
and so we're going to use people that we're in a relationship with that we know that you know we know are people of integrity so
yeah but uh [vocalized-noise] those are all great the the interesting thing we're getting ready to have a house built
[noise]
[noise]
yeah mine too
yes
that that's that's that's very good that's i i like that so i would uh i would i would vote for her without and i i suspect she could get a large voter turnout
there is convoluted logic for you
i have to find a place around here that has that
just a little sherry to thin it and stir that in you can even put a spoon of ketchup in and that makes a great pork dish with a sort of a spicy sweet sauce
yeah
um
that's true i found that out when i was in high school i worked at mcdonald's
yeah i know it was
uh-huh [laughter]
two yeah
yeah but my mother does not miss a game and you just don't know she lives in california and i do not call her on sunday in foot- during football season i just don't do it
um-hum
oh [laughter] you have to get used to hills [laughter]
[noise]
[vocalized-noise]
sometimes it seems like during the trial part the jury's not you know misses some of the best evidence because they make them leave and
sometimes i think the jury is ignorant in the facts of law and how things should be determined and they're too easily swayed by their emotion
trading their lives for cigarettes
uh the american association in in gautolompora uh actually had uh uh an s._p._c._a. there and we went down and picked us up a little old female mongrel and uh and brought her home and she made an excellent pet
but i had a cat i have a i had a cat uh
but uh there are some huge dogs around here it's really phenomenal i cannot see i mean i've seen everything from
trucking through the parking lot [laughter]
you know i i just i love it when i can get up and throw on sweats or just throw on jeans and tie sneakers and [noise] and i'm fine [noise]
yeah
that's pretty good i mean it's it's not something you see every day so it's i guess it that that keeps the quality a little higher
that's what i've heard
yeah but who cares about my opinion [laughter]
it's uh it's interesting that that uh they encourage us to do things
you know feasible i mean i know a lot of college kids who have them you know who had them but
that's mostly locally the banks will line up with uh
well have we spent our at least five minutes [laughter] okay [laughter]
so see it's really strange
huh i don't know but i know someone who goes to massachusetts and buys cars that have been wrecked or uh salvaged they p- they might have been stolen and
yeah it wasn't that bad and uh but they are big and they're kind of hard to drive
that's that's a pretty good deal
well that
well you don't have to get a lot of stuff out you know [laughter]
[laughter]
yeah saturday morning which is you know i i go to those when i can
and he'll call us up and say let's go and so we'll meet you know real early in the morning people think we're crazy because we get up so early in the morning but i love it [laughter]
and i got all three of them on tape and i'm fixing to tape this other one that's coming on monday
my husband likes the weights period that's it he wants to be up like he wants to he says i'm going to pump up i said uh-huh
they didn't even re- they didn't they didn't have any remorse for what they were doing but they were just so ignorant
not where i live uh but i live outside of dallas
that's right and i don't know personally i'd like to get rid of him i think he's sort of a showboat and really hadn't produced you know a whole lot but uh
oh really
he claims to be out there to play ball
i take it from there
uh-huh tex tower yeah
well that's better than having them living with you
yeah i just c- i just think that i it would help a lot if i got a job
uh-huh uh-huh
you know i mean i just don't believe it i think there are other ways to fix it even though sometimes there aren't but
[laughter]
okay
yeah and then in the end um she basically ended up stealing a hundred dollars from me so i was i had a pretty bad taste in my mouth she told me about five thirty one afternoon it was a friday that she wasn't keeping kids anymore as of monday morning
but
really
i don't know
they just seemed to be more rugged but uh the cars just seem to fall apart
uh-huh
uh there are not i don't think that there are that many people that feel that way that with what they could get support for
i mean
uh-huh
[laughter]
um
but i do like comfort i like uh uh we have bigger automobiles now we've got pontiacs
i still have to pay it yeah that's just like up here too
well uh a couple years ago we we purchased an uh well it wasn't n- it wasn't new it was a a a an astro van and
[vocalized-noise]
[noise] i you know i was going into the grocery store and a [noise] a lightning bolt was almost directly overhead and it was twenty six degrees out
yeah
yeah
y- you know you you get s- you get in a rut i- if you do play a lot but you play with the same people you you aren't going to learn anything uh after after a short period once you learn everything they've got to offer then uh
you
uh
public good is at stake and the company good is at stake and
yeah that that it's a major cause of uh early
um yes yes we're [vocalized-noise]
and sometimes they don't even take everything tha- that's the biggest kick
yeah oxbridge is nice
hey that's a hard job to get really
and we like we bought we filled a fu- a cooler full of food of all this delicatessen food [laughter] and then
i got got my
they they used to be but they've gotten they've got to pay for all that national advertising now
[noise] we put ours up
yeah
from anybody else
yeah
because that's the lowest thing for themselves plus there's nobody for them to look up to
because we're paying for social security they using now who's gonna pay for mine
right
and so it's a little bit larger but that's the only the only difference that i see really
i am not really crazy about driving i never have been since you know my parents had to force me to get my driver's license when i was young when i was sixteen
yep
well the the whole
and i'm there several times a year
and i'm i'm supposed to be an adult
yeah the the i mean people like that are crazy i i did a study on it though when i was in high school it was one of these things
[laughter]
um-hum
oh
oh golly that's not the kind we do do you go camping
i don't know
yeah
you know it's easy to say well yeah let's let's put these old folks in a home but when i think i don't want to do that you know i don't want to be have my little home i always threaten my daughters i say well
right by herself
lock him up
so but those are the things that get us going or get us stirred up sometimes
right
[noise]
oh really [laughter]
yeah so i am we are sort of we are the middle east peace talks at home um
didn't hurt me you know at at at the moment so um and and i i don't know there's a there's something about there's a poem somewhere i don't know if you've ever seen it or not um um everything i ever wanted to know i learned in kindergarten
they sent me uh a small flag in the mail that whi- which had postage due [laughter]
okay
oh
i know a little bit about other groups
huh
and then just sort of told well you're here now you're part of our country and
yeah
they they they might the the baltic states might be feeling the same way that our forefathers felt when they were leaving to come here
they uh they weren't real profe- well we don't know for sure but they hit they took they knew right where to go that's what scares me
well that that's real scary
yeah
and they were sort of tame every now and then they'd let you pet them
her
i see my sons-in-law i have a daughter who's a nurse and i have a daughter who's a beautician and i see my sons-in-law cooking
uh-huh
i don't believe in this career you know this career drive when when they're small because i think they're downstairs aaron i think that's very um
my wife used to they matched hers only hers was a little bit better than ours um she hasn't been working for a couple of years her father took sick so she's been taking care of him
[vocalized-noise] i look at mine and he's getting out of school and i'm saying geez you know i'm glad i'm not starting out now because
yeah
um-hum
yeah and -at's the other thing is that [vocalized-noise] you know instead of making it mandatory they may- maybe need to publicize it a little bit better and and uh you know go to the schools and
oh i'm sure
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] the weather down here is a lot different than than it is uh uh at home [laughter] yeah
yeah
that seems to make a lot of difference and you have the colored glass and the clear glass and the paper and the tin cans
and it it all goes back to the government spending enough money high enough priorities on things like that
um-hum
yeah and
uh and i thought that was you know very interesting and i- i would have thought of that earlier i probably would have done you know just like is that is this is that the mormon church
um-hum
we love our freedom and our freedom of choice
uh-huh
the um they dr- they drilled a well i don't know how many feet but it was three or four times deeper than it needed to be
through your pipes because it's toxic um chlorine it's toxic it's a i don't know if your on city water city water has chlorine in it chlorine causes cancer
uh-huh
so that was
yeah yeah
[laughter]
and uh that's the only soap i watch anymore
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah
i much prefer to stay in the house in my air conditioning and look at it without working in it
hi mary have you gone visiting uh any [vocalized-noise] new restaurants lately
yeah right after they started i guess the other uh businesses lost money and they all began doing the same thing
oh well it [vocalized-noise] one thing that gets me is when you see them do uh putting out the um the um knives forks and what have you and when they put them down they hold them by the edge that you are going to put in your mouth
well
[laughter] the only crazy comedy i [noise] really like is saturday night live [laughter]
but the mu- movie sh- uh cables or movie channels they show the same shows over and over and over
but uh
take it when you want to yeah
yeah
you know and and do the job well
and uh
um-hum
the
yeah
you didn't
yeah
good years but not too many
well they made it uh extremely uh easy for the employee yeah i can just
oh that's quite reasonable
no i i just painted
oh uh-huh
i happen to have had a tough day at work and maybe i'm trying to get a project done uh at school
goodness or badness with uh things now with the music that's behinds them
where they they brew their own beer there
have you ever gone to like dinner theaters or or uh things like that
oh yeah
so how do you handle do you got any kids
how are rents doing i haven't looked at rents in a long time
and things like that um we pretty much hire we subcontract mostly everything i mean other than anything that's not a um i mean i know how to fix a running toilet
oh yeah
[vocalized-noise] well i have heard a lot about possum kingdom
oh boy
yeah
yeah
yeah
no
i don't i don't miss the cold at all but i don't mind the heat
uh-huh
hum
so i want to get a new uh four eighty six chip but i don't know
[laughter]
[laughter] we think about that a lot [laughter]
i think we should have stayed longer
uh the farthest away from home
wouldn't it have been wonderful
fifty miles north of that up in the panhandle to just go buy a pair of jeans we'd drive an hour
uh they can't hardly trade him because nobody wants to pay that much for him and if they just keep him that hurts their salary cap so that guy's got dallas in a big old bind
more of a football powerhouse i guess
well they had i don't think it was last year the year before they were doing really good and i think they had an off year last year
um-hum
but uh i- i have one mainly i bought it because i'm in uh taking a lot of courses along with work and [vocalized-noise] it's very useful in that respect but i hope to do something more with it [noise]
it really does
or it just builds up so often yeah
you to take care bye-bye
and we we sort of have to get accustomed to the fact that our body temperature is thirty seven degrees centigrade [laughter] yes
you know i just when i going into it i just had this block and i went there's just no way i'm going to be able to learn this and when i sat down and really said okay just you know forget your old prejudices and really look at it you know and once you look at it's so really simple you know you
they just [laughter] that's that's incredible
yeah yeah
right
right
um-hum
role of the teacher has incrementally gotten lower and lower value and society i mean relative pay which is a major way we value people has been
and um i'm heavily involved in you know my own personal recycling we recycle paper and cans here at work and you know i do the newspaper and cardboard and paper and
uh-huh
yeah well um i've never fully served i mean i've been asked twice to go down but i didn't get elected on the panel
so you like that more civilized kind of camping you got cots [laughter]
yeah she fooled you
no
oh man
that's right and they probably will soon so
that's right
oh i don't think that would be bad at all if you're in richardson you'd probably wanted to come to the to the dallas site
but i- i guess things have gotten better i've been told that there's flex hour and those kind of things
we'll s- maybe do our small part to fix them up
well i ran into a problem with my car uh course we have a little colder weather up here and i had set the emergency brake after we'd had a freezing rain apparently
put a set of brakes on my little blazer that we have and fortunately i- i could do most of the work myself but uh this last time that i
right
i don't know
so there's where the money goes [laughter]
they really have a lot of variety
here's where here's a calculator but it's not even made by t._i. isn't that funny
oh oh
uh-huh babbly i'll say that is [laughter] well we'll have to keep up with that then [laughter]
[laughter] oh there's some wonderful christian uh children's tapes
all right
let me just quick catch it and i'll be back
yeah my mom um she's a housewife and well there's twelve kids in my family so my mom never could really work you know because she was kind of pregnant from day one she never really had a chance to work
yeah
that's right
yeah
your reimbursement didn't come through [laughter]
oh i know it's it's christmas is the worst time f- i just have to leave them at home uh because the impulse buying is just terrible
i think it just depends on what the what the banks will take
yeah well uh ours usually consists of mcdonald's
what were you in
um
well we um we just moved to our first home and we had lived in a condominium before so
grass
uh-huh
oh that's even better
well i think it deterred i think it deterred hussein from doing anything else because if w- if for example we we let hussein go in there and take kuwait then
yep
although um
oh really
does san antonio ha- you said san antonio right
[laughter]
[laughter]
at the present time we have none we intend to uh purchase a pup in two months
yeah they just poop and it's yeah they
uh-huh
i have done you know in the meantime like i said so many baby gifts i've made a lot of bibs
and and they're all a handful so it's got to be something she can do fairly easily and fairly quickly
uh not really it's not too easy
yeah it's in great shape uh body is in excellent shape it just needs paint i need to look up some place to uh to get the car painted
and then uh
yeah
uh-huh
one of which is the you know extreme interest rate on most of them
so
[noise]
okay the car if i buy a car it'd probably be an american made car
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum and you probably have children at home which takes up a lot more time
we have we have two miniature dachshunds and ten fish
and i- i th- i thi-
right
yes right right
something
well the kids you know the kids wanted
uh-huh
i was amazed when i took our taxes to our tax person and she works out of her home also and the uh software that does the taxes is just incredible you know i mean she just
oh i do too i do too the the on line um encyclopedia just sounds wonderful you know th- that sounds like such a great idea you know it'd be nice to kind of fun to be to be able to play with it
perhaps is using it for education i have a four year old son and we have some education programs that he likes a little sesame street one and um we have another one that plays music and he really likes that one
[laughter]
right
and he rides through the clouds you know and you see him coming out of the clouds his head coming out and then the bird coming out and it you know they're flying all over with it
they changed some things in the movie wasn't the same i thought the book was better
um-hum they
[laughter] there is a whole lot of stuff going on out there and and part of me says i just would like to you know shut my eyes and pretend it doesn't you know go on
um-hum
well actually the little gray tabby wanders out in the back yard occasionally i have an eight foot uh security type fence out in the backyard she just kind of goes out and rolls around on the patio and comes back in
yes i've had a german shepherd that did that one time
and just watches everything yeah she she enjoys the car
yeah a- actually you know fish is not their natural food that's that's the
uh-huh
or i use a visa all the time
huh yeah
and so they're going in a mission trip into latvia
he's
no
yeah
yeah
i think the team coming up is the raiders
and uh he had put doug flutie in
uh but i like uh
uh you may disagree with him but i i i find this whole what do you think of this uh fourteen one and ten four one in dallas
[noise]
for the immigrant
and i don't hold it against the people
and they've got a real nice building down there on a great big piece of land
[laughter]
yeah
yeah but it's it's not like saying like i'm born and then when i reached a certain age i'm going to have to do something you know
right right
that sounds good
so
you've learned a lot
yeah walsh didn't have that much uh well as you probably guessed i'm a cowboy fan
yeah and and and and and the seventies were really a it it saw the team's emergence as a super power coincided with the movement to texas stadium
yeah
and uh
that they should you know make him understand it it's just like them saying that we should understand what bush is doing
yep
right
i mean he's you know he's so messed up
you know top rated pool
just barely
what
[laughter]
when you go across the lake um i don't know why we have so much going for us
yeah
that's the stuff that koala bears eat in australia or something
hou- houston is awful
yeah
yeah that that's that's so true i mean they say well you voice your opinion uh uh uh on election day
uh dependents or anything my children are all grown
right
[laughter]
which is seems to be exactly what's happening right at the moment
that's right
uh-huh
the basics uh right
uh-huh yeah
what
uh-huh
well what would you have at a dinner party
well um how long do you cook the meatballs
make us dinner one time uh just to even it out since we seemed to be unfairly doing all the cooking and they were doing all the enjoying i'm
sure
right
um if you don't have all the special tools and the technology i i'd i would hate to buy a brand new car today with the electronics that are in them
you got it i
and then you know if you didn't have a car that had one in it then your insurance would go up enormously
four people with with luggage and uh course this grant it that's you know it's been four years ago but it's remarkable that the that the bigger vans uh they're
uh-huh
[laughter]
well i just got back from taking my little girl to her brownie meeting and then we had this whole can uh a bag filled full of cans and they've been recycling at their school well she wanted me to just wait and let her dump them off tomorrow
well that
gettysburg
oh that makes sense so i mean are you in terms of other things like like like not running but playing te- little bit of tennis or can you not do stuff like that at all
exercise is not supposed to do that to you
sure
wanted the right to do that [laughter] so i i have a rifle in the house um the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it but uh
yeah
[laughter]
semi for them too so yeah
well yeah i kind of like it when they do that because the video like i said there are certain things you can't do with a video and the idea that they may put a little extra in it i think is a good idea
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
yeah it is in fact it's i think it's on tonight [laughter] i just got in from outside so i so i'm kind of
right
[noise]
so that you always see their friends rather than make them not welcome and they're always over in someone else's house so our we've been lucky that uh our house is usually the place where the kids could come you know and
you're not too sure what's going on he tells parents all the time haul them into the doctor's office and get them checked
[noise] i could sure tell the difference though after the first year or so of being there uh prior to
yeah
yeah yeah
um-hum
for uh two or three thousand dollars even cheaper than the best deal they can give you
and so she's going to get some money for that and take some money from the bank and then try to make as much down payment as possible to keep the monthly payment low
so i just walked across the street and bought a car so to speak yeah you know it was really convenient when i was there because i'd just pull it in during the day you know i worked second shift at that time and i'd just leave my car you know
smashing it smashing it with their door makes me so angry or breaking into it we have such a rash of break-ins
um-hum
[laughter]
or adults that is can't even read and and we've got the lowest rates of civilized countries in science and math
um you know the parent wasn't parent wasn't wealthy so he had to uh do something to put himself through school and he d- and he did and he was very successful [vocalized-noise]
yeah they both have their place but but you know when it gets right down to it
yeah
um-hum
okay i didn't know that because i got to be pushing ten some where i lost count around six or seven
uh because after all the degree just gets you in the door
[laughter] that's sound like a good deal
i had yeah i was in public school i was in all honors classes i was also a a national merit scholar
oh jeez
[laughter] so i thought i have better things to do i can do this myself and so oh i guess i was getting ready to start that was it it wasn't even off so i started
oh oh yeah yeah i never really noticed how effective they were
yeah we we have a we have a dog and that's just about as bad as a kid [laughter]
um-hum
that's anticommunist you know we kind of had a tendency to be pro [laughter] it don't matter what their excesses were and i believe at the time that i was down there that uh the
i had wondered sometimes i knew that there was a lot of a lot of effort and a lot of work went into a lot of that and i just wondered if if it lasted and if it took you know like yeah [vocalized-noise]
yeah
and then all the other th- the rest of us did and he was like six hundred dollars yeah and it was we were we all had it was a viral pneumonia it was really bad and and we were just horribly sick but i mean six hundred dollars i can't come up with
we try not to we're probably the only two people in the united states the bank the banks don't want to hear from us because they want those people who charge it up to ten thousand dollars uh and then get all yeah and then pay fifty dollars a month and it all goes to interest
uh we but we both
[noise] yeah i'm surprised that more states doesn't do that
so yeah i could too and uh gah i don't think we can say anything else really
to
is exposed to
you know if i- i- i- i know they tried to turn it into a holy war because to them that is what's honorable you know to to if you die in in a holy cause but but i think they're smart enough see there was nothing holy about it we just wanted their land and took it you know [laughter] um
and a few people i guess will make a few people pretty wealthy in construction and so forth
had no had no teeth
i don't know what to do about it
oh yeah
i wouldn't now because i don't know of one that's that's equipped to handle
and and would that make it worse or would that make it better or would that offer new opportunities for other people
they're they're they're just everywhere and and you know set up in trailers [laughter] i seen one on preston road that was set up in a trailer for a while before they built the little building
uh-huh
[noise]
they uh they they want to know things are going to be a certain way
we've got some nice uh
i don't eith- well um you know the- what you don't hear about is how many they turn away
[laughter] wrapped up in their carpet [laughter]
sure
yeah
yeah yeah
right
the uh antarctica conti- continent you know uh it it expands out over australia and at certain times of the year
[noise]
that's right
i kind of think it was necessary i mean i i- i- i don't i'm not a a big um
well do you keep up with the statistical stuff
uh when i was in college i l- i enjoyed teaching because i did some teaching part-time and i really enjoyed that but i wouldn't wanna go teach high school or junior high it just you know too many problems
or our state legislature can't come up with uh some kind of workable means to have funds for the school you know it's uh i just don't understand that
where in new hampshire
oh great
it tends to be in the fall yeah that's that's a beautiful time in new hampshire yeah [noise] yeah
[vocalized-noise]
right and i think one other area here is that um this is typically what we call in this area yuppie area and people aren't my kids you know other than you know occasionally they're not even aware that there are people over fifty that
[noise]
well do you own a p._c.
yeah
oh
well no i worked for this company before i had my first daughter
um [laughter] i guess i i've got so many books like that that i need to read it's it's hard for me to do a lot of uh reading yeah reading just for enjoyment
you haven't
ha- do you like ken follett
are where you from originally
well i used to um i used to know uh fairly close to exactly how many miles i drove because i- i was very convenient i lived uh uh nine tenths of a mile from work
yeah
now i- i- i ask that because my wife is from the palestine area in east texas and you can tell she's native too yeah
yeah
what types of crafts do you do
yeah oh yeah right in the tub and and it helps because it's the time of the year that they're shedding a lot and cleaning cat fur off the couch and off the floor is not a hobby of mine so i thought well this'll help you know help them shed and
but
i share your your uh sense when you change job to work or job to home uh the way your your image of the machine changes i tend to do slightly different things at home than i do at work um
would probably not be satisfied with anything less than a really nice one and that's that's a quite an expense and then all the software tends to be uh
um-hum [noise] and i know when i spent the time that i've studied in mexico uh since spanish was one of my majors in college [noise] that uh there was a kind of a lot of resentment there towards america
always yes ma'am
right
uh-huh
and there are sometimes you just don't feel like eating out and i wish i had something a little bit different to just zap together [noise]
um-hum
communications
oh okay
okay well we're we're we're very strong uh wo- women's basketball team fans
oh are you going to put them in the house do you like to
um-hum
um-hum
i've seen more and more companies that have um parental leave not just maternity leave they can grant paternity leave as well as maternity leave
um-hum oh that's true that's true
she's she's yeah this is her second term i think she's going to going to uh not going to run again after this but
yeah
on nationally basketball
i don't know those three uh detroit hasn't been having that great a year this year
uh
oh quality okay
for criminal action
how much
and uh i worked full time all last year and now i'm going to school part time and uh graduate school and i'm working part time and so i'm still yeah i'm still going full time but i only have half time salary
yeah
yeah i bet [laughter]
so it's a little high but but it's you know like it's where where he was before i was only paying sixty three so i mean there was there's quite a little jump there but you know i looked all over louisville
pardon me
i know
oh [vocalized-noise] oh gosh i can't wait -til mine gets old enough to do that
um-hum
uh it's time consuming and at times even ridiculous but it th- tha- nobody's come up with any better solution
um-hum
[laughter] yes
not necessarily in that order
and yeah we do do things and
i would love to live up there
[noise]
yeah
y- well it is c._n._n. exactly uh because uh and it because uh
oh that didn't uh
the sentencing yeah i- ag- i agree with you right i do agree with you i- i figure that it's been a couple of years now since i've served now so i'm i've been looking lately for mine [laughter] it's about time for me to get called up down there again
we didn't have to struggle at all with that it was now what's fitting and and we'd gone through you know all that so i- i don't know i thought that was easier than than trying to decide his guilt or innocence yeah
yeah
um-hum
uh-huh
but they have lot of times they'll have like uh little cabins and three or four or five families can stay in those cabins because they have you know just the single bunk beds and stuff
because maybe they those are not the clothes that are the most uh appealing to you or the most um complimentary to you
it it uh definitely fluctuates mainly with what i'm going to be doing that day and kind of what my mood is and when it's raining i'm more likely to wear jeans and and when it's really cold i'm more likely to wear jeans or pants or sweaters or that type of thing
uh right
yeah uh yeah i agree with you on that
and uh th- you know they're a quality car they
uh-huh
that's right
watch yeah yeah i don't blame you
you know i- i think to be you know c- being convicted is one thing you know and that's and that's great if they're con- if they're sentenced to death
so he comes in and tell us all these bizarre cases you know [noise] and he said you can pretty much you know if you ever get on a jury you know you're not told this but if you ever get on a jury you can pretty much guess whatever you sentence them to they're going to serve about a quarter
oh lord [laughter]
it's not deliverance but it's pretty good [laughter]
braunfels
um-hum
um-hum
yes but but maybe well prevent a few john hinkleys
yeah we do too yeah i figure they'll make enough noise but
we're certainly not the smallest home and we're not the largest home but it has maintained itself in that the homes that were built afterwards
late in november and the winter was coming
[noise]
southwest where
and the only [vocalized-noise] game type shows that i ever watch are wheel of fortune
well uh everything's high priced out here [laughter] but uh uh
a young woman who uh was accused of killing her
right
i don't know maybe it maybe it should be stressed through you know public education in schools you know or something i don't know
and uh it's it's just like a different different world getting involved with those kinds with those with those people in politics so it is in- very interesting
oh and that can make a difference too i mean
um
that's called federal hill and
i'm afraid to take the chance when i go down there
i like italian food
but i haven't really thought about you know the economy all that much and and eating out we we never really did it a lot but
i think it's what number did i just say eighteen something that is the same as a three-quarter and it that i i'd rather have it all metric
sure
uh what am i taking uh master's in public administration
really the biggest way
give people a concrete get people to agree on a concrete idea of just exactly what government is supposed to be doing for them no more no less and cut government back down to that size
yeah no nobody could figure it out i mean the the book was so much uh there's just things all you can do is put it in words you can't put it in pictures and a lot of that stuff that was going on in the film you c- say what is this
a lot of a lot of people did but it would have to be a good show
gotten worse in my opinion in the past few years
yeah
right
uh
[noise] well when we've painted um [noise]
do you think we should direct the government
um
on one hand you have you know that the the you know the the soviet government of course mistreating a lot of the uh slovak countries and then on the other hand you have
[noise] hi wanet how are you
well she ended up staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care [laughter] i mean it cost me over five hundred dollars
or or you know grant you with their presence you know
and that's the reason i said maybe if you had something like a block party okay we're going to have a block party everybody's going to get together we're going to discuss the different issues and stuff and then we're going to go and vote you know we're going to go vote like
absolutely
right
oh no [laughter] in her little bridesmaid dress [laughter]
well those maine coon cats were great they were fourteen pounds and
well
i got to where i decided i wanted to pay more rent and get a private bedroom
[noise]
seemed like the thing to do at the time
you know there's some paid moves occasionally
that's right
and i'll bet they don't i'll bet you don't i- i would imagine legitimate gun dealers you'd have background checks but i'll bet if somebody goes in and offers a pawnshop
well i in my younger years i'd always heard the adage you should uh buy as much of a house as you can afford
but uh we have a family dog that uh ate all of the children's toys
wow
wow wow that's pretty pretty bizarre [laughter] the dog ate the christmas presents
because it's out on video now but it's still playing at the dollar theater i'm glad i got to see it there rather it's t._v. just doesn't have the same impact
right
something about cowboys uh
they let her tug their hair and and get on their back or whatever and she's she's grown up with them and loves them to death and they love her so
oh no
oh i bet the black one's pretty
um the last thing he chewed up was
um-hum
but uh yeah i- i think that's great
other than that that's the major problems i've had i used to change my own oil and filter but i got tired of that so i let somebody else do it [laughter]
yeah it was i'm sure it was
they you know they were kind of loose and so but these people were telling me that they needed to be replaced
they live there and they have to travel by boat forty five minutes to get to their car and stuff
lo mas yeah
neither of us had any help with our college degrees and just this last month we paid off my final school loan so [laughter] we're starting our kids a little bit early
um okay
[laughter]
long haired yeah and
yeah she's fairly young we we've bred her once and and that's all we're going to breed her so uh
um-hum
yeah well i think one thing too that makes this easier for me is that i uh do this at a recreation center and it takes me about three minutes to drive up there
that's really good
yeah
yeah
and then i would do them like two times a day but i don't do any of that kind of stuff anymore i think having children everything just kind of everything goes by the wayside
but it's got lots of good recipes so i was thinking about trying to sell that on the side just [noise] for fun
um-hum
and just because they had had a couple of bad seasons and you can't even attribute those bad seasons to bad coaching
yeah that uh i kind of gave up on them
right
uh-huh an- because it was funny i mean everybody was furious i was so mad i got up and went and called [laughter] you know i couldn't believe that but
so what's the answer
um-hum
why is this stuff so expensive why is the cost going up so incredibly fast
yeah
my my problem with immigration is when you take people that has been here on welfare or trying to make it
um-hum
uh-huh i know they're real popular here at school also
yeah
it's a little more understandable under the circumstances i guess
um-hum
it's
[laughter] well i'll probably hold on to it since it's still under warranty but
you know but i've seen one of those and it's not that great i mean because they really
hello okay
you know i still do it once in a while
[noise]
yeah so uh what are your favorite t._v. shows
sunday afternoons actually around here
um eleven o'clock here and i think they put it like eleven o'clock
oh really
yeah it's it's stopped around here at ten and it goes into night programs
um i don't know what the what the uh company plant is they went through i guess key personnel first
uh-huh
uh
um-hum
my dad's grew up on a farm and he always had gardens and we always had fresh vegetables which i just really like and
yeah [laughter]
um-hum
yeah
because you never know if you're going to get knifed or something uh you know as a guard that it must be scary [laughter] uh
[noise] i like everything but jazz
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
[laughter]
um they're they're registered but they're not they're not uh they're not show cats
uh gee
[laughter] you can't just tell them that anyway but [laughter] oh dear well it really sounds like uh uh a business more than a hobby
one of the two that's right that's right i don't know i just i know you know i i look at some of the millions of dollars that we you know give to other countries every year
yeah
um-hum
when i travel i use them
but i just
[noise]
huh
yeah i guess so
yeah
you bet
they don't they're not labeled c._e._o. [laughter] you know they're they're uh assembly line type jobs and
i noticed in uh an article in the paper where i didn't read the whole article but you know the headlines anyway indicated that there's a a seems to be a consensus among small and medium size business owners
uh-huh
from the time he was in the seventh grade and uh a small allowance and all the way through college and he held three jobs
oh oh i started out as a p._e. major
[laughter]
we lived in new hampshire at the time
oh really that is awful [laughter]
sometimes the deejays are just kind of annoying and irritating and uh it gets kind of old and they play the same songs over and over and i just get kind of tired of all that
too much trouble to get up and go decide what i want to listen to and put it on the on the turntable i don't know i just don't don't bother to do it very much anymore
but i'm doing all right getting over it
you have to make yourself do it yeah
uh bye-bye
that's certainly no kind of deterrent and i would tend to agree with anybody who says right now that it it's not a deterr- uh a deterrent because it's not
wow [laughter]
and uh let's see we are to compare homes correct
[noise] reasonable construction would probably run you uh
the their they do have an extremely good such things as extremely good school systems for example it has one of the best school systems in the country
hm i wasn't even looking for a car when i bought this car i uh
right
well let me try it once more [noise]
um no
um-hum
oh really
yeah
i know
[vocalized-noise] the the black guy that
and by giving it to them they take it in mass and then our junk dealer gives them ten dollars just because they've they're a church and he writes it off as a donation but it's a real problem with
um-hum
i mean if it's if it's uh foo- you know if it's stuff you scraped off your plate it can go into the compost and you know and so it's i mean
well that's right
i have two daughters
right
yeah
oh yeah no doubt about it i i usually go until the the recording comes on
right
[noise]
you know uh but i- i see it all too often i mean we've got loads of foreign students
yeah
uh well they're they're coming from various places and a lot of them are going back there
and uh one of the things that uh we did uh just we sort of made a little garden that uh surrounded the trees and planted uh pachysandra
oh uh-huh
there you go that's right that's true i understand that
[laughter] yeah
oh
and used to travel up there to knox quite a bit and and i even did once when i was a child you know so
yeah out here in california there's a program like that for uh juvenile delinquents the the ones that are not dangerous and they don't have to be locked up go to these uh camps
right and that i'm sure that would make a big difference too
if if everybody bands together it's just like we need to get rid of these clowns that's serving in the office
yeah i don't i don't think that's that's quite right either
that one
well yeah i know some of those some of those shows are very moving um
uh-huh
yeah no tha- that was that was horrible it was [vocalized-noise] and sh- she never even got to see her family that she came in to visit
i- it it's just it's a m- it's just a big huge mess because because my husband's grandmother has a lot of health problems
[noise]
no no i am not taking the tree you know i mean every time we went outside he'd he'd look at something that was humongous you know no we're not taking that
but we have like a lot like my mom likes flowers so we have a lot of flowers too
yeah but um well even up here at school you know y- it gets hot and we have the windows open well they mow the grass up here sometimes six o'clock in the morning and just to smell the grass it's just i just love the smell of freshly cut grass
troubles and the like and some of their their crime problems
ticked off with uh seeing this violence so much of it on t._v. and so forth in the movies
well i- i do too and uh uh i work for texas instruments an- and they have a mandatory drug testing before you hire in and uh
golly that is terrible
uh-huh well i've got an eleven year old son and an eight year old daughter and my son says i don't understand this drug stuff why don't people understand all you have to do is say no
um he's uh he's pretty decent pitcher he's
yep
uh-huh
[laughter]
yeah they they go f- uh year-round uh teach them now in the summer they have like a lot of field trips
i don't mind paying more
so what do you what's your opinion on the our policy down there
right
yeah you know the people have a right to know except about what it about what concerns them
and uh he actually he turns out to be a law man
yeah
oh i don't i don't watch that [laughter] um
uh-huh
yeah
uh
right an
uh-huh
uh now it's a little more expensive to make it because y- you know you start paying the price for the patterns and the material but it's still such better quality that i think it's worth it
so i try to save that for the weekend i need to get better at it though [laughter]
but in the new he's looking at your heart and so i guess that's what what i mean by their character changes and you know what i mean it's like looking beyond what they're doing and looking at a heart and seeing what is the heart what's the character showing me here and
hum punishment thank you i'm sorry i just got home from work and i'm just kind of spaced out a little bit uh that not all of them are being um
what a lot of people tend to believe happens in a prison
i agree that would be something that would have to be
th- that or any side arm whether it be a blade or whether it be a handgun or whatever
you know with this you know i don't know
uh-huh
well what's your views on it
we got a lot of problems here too i do mean
that's true
um but i had lived in my own little bubble up until that time and and after traveling around the world a few times i realized that things ain't the way they seem
some examples are this uh some of the things like jimmy carter's been involved in uh a little program to you know fix up housing for people
i think um well i guess it would be like your generation compared to my generation i think your generation is um what do i say uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
at least two
i am a widow so uh and i have a handicapped son so i have to really set my priorities of what you know but this is one thing that i do enjoy very much doing
[laughter]
uh
so it's [vocalized-noise] basically mindless i mean all your you the only really thing you are having to use is connecting the things that they give you you know what you're hearing and your your sigh- uh your sight but they give you everything else and
oh yes
yeah the snowbirds were the
right well uh well here what they do and i i contend that it's certainly not the right thing to do they spread salt
and either that or all either have also uh uh second shifts
yeah i- i think usually as a general [vocalized-noise] rule the best man wins most of the time
but i think in national elections uh again it should be the time is definitely against the people i think you ought to have two days you're voting for president
wow i've i've never heard of that before
um-hum
uh-huh
[laughter] yeah i can imagine i i know how things are up there
north or south of you
hum
the more disciplined kids you know they're not dealing with the whole gamut of personalities here they're they're private schools do not put up with
it uh the children there are a lot a lot wilder than what i was used to i was gr- i grew up in a very protective home and then whenever i got to high school things were just
yeah i think that'll be fun so we're going to try to do that like on a three day weekend go there and
no i've haven't gone camping in years but it's something that i've done in the past how about you
that was great and even at that it it was like the first time that i ventured you know out of the city by myself and and you know i i stayed in a nice place but it's still it's real different not to have another adult with you
and i actually um i mean helped them them in the sense that they received money for working with me but i didn't i didn't i wasn't a social worker or anything like that
and i don't know what the solution is
yeah i i cast a ways i'm not highly proficient but it's fun
slipping it out there
with the little thing on the end yeah i thought it had a weight
his big thing last year was throwing it in the water and reeling it up [laughter] that was what he considered fishing [laughter] this year he's gotten to where he can we we were at a friend's uh stock pond were out at their farm
yeah that's true
and uh it it's pretty much headline news
it was a new situation
there's a couple of places around that are like uh yuppie i mean it it seems like a big thing now with uh with diners uh
[laughter]
yeah
right
and when the kids are in halls and stuff and if they're being really good i mean just being excellent they're not you know cutting up and so on they're just standing in line doing whatever they are supposed to they get one of these caught being good slips
as a part of the revamping of the entire education system on that lev- the public school system i want to see changed too
well the
okay
yeah
and i think that's what you know i think it really uh that's what makes it very makes it difficult and uh this year's much more relaxed [laughter]
um-hum
so um but it's not a very good topic it feels like if you know not when you're n- neither one of us are really
you never realize because that janitor comes around and empties your garbage can every night
so it's one of those things that they really um and you wonder you know with all these oil spills
see i don't see a lot of t._i. advertisements on t._v. anyway i think they advertise more um other places where they're not located
yeah scrape it and paint it put primer on it then paint it
very important
you know my didn't do much at all and didn't know much about cars and
yeah
yeah i like uh comedies a lot uh movies and uh sports programs in particular
uh-huh
um-hum
hum
i think it's unfortunate uh as far as the kurds are concerned it
they're terrible you know it's just like it's a dog eat dog world
yeah i'm trying to think what i've seen lately i me- well well [laughter] we just finished watching uh teenage mutant ninja turtles on tape you know [laughter]
[noise] h-
do you like the classics like uh gone with the wind and uh you know the older movies
okay i know i saw yeah something about it
when the pressure is really on when it's down to the last few minutes of the game for the season is when the guys seem to really do their best
yeah i'm sure you know i mean my sentimental favorite would have to be philadelphia but i i sure am scared of them giants
uh
huh
well the
in our state currently when in colorado whenever you fill out uh your state income tax
yeah i think we we kind of shoot ourselves in the foot that way too it's bad enough that the soviets do it
so until i see the entire
you mean i understand when they pulled the troops out of uh
really
boring
and uh she said hey go for the swimming pool she says you get just as much if you did the aerobics on the floor she says in fact you get more
i don't know i've been i've been sitting here thinking here because it was you know took a couple tries before i found somebody well you know i'm like i'm not really sure what i think about this um
uh-huh well the thing about that is though it's got a i mean because it was i mean it was big you [vocalized-noise] remember like in the early seventies and all that and
oh well good good you have a little time think about that i guess i- i have uh when i was teaching school i saw many ki- so many kids that were at loose ends
okay
uh-huh
well i imagine they're just starting
uh my job takes me out of the country a lot and it always seems to be during the summer uh last year we got to go out maybe about a dozen times which is the most we've ever gone out and we had about uh the rangers
i don't know the phillies are so uh unpredictable
um
and then you just set your cauliflower in there and then you cook it for seven minutes on high and you rotate it one time
uh-huh
okay
and and where did you say you were from
um it's a problem if those voting don't represent the population demographically or in terms of their opinions but if those who don't vote if you made them vote and it those who don't vote would have voted exactly the same way
i don't know i kind of part of me is wary and part of me likes the idea of having it be more of a duty
uh-huh
and
is the american government going to force us to go
yeah but the idea was is that by with five fifths um they could uh they could uh they could sell five and and
[noise]
right because clothes are s- are really expensive you know uh uh a little simple shell shell blouse you know that you can make for about
i try to dre- dress presentable but very comfortable
well
uh certainly not presidential but but quite possibly v._p.
[noise]
person to sort of
[noise]
yeah
well down there you get uh uh some more aromatic aromas like the uh the smell of the pine forest and uh
i may have put out an exclamation here at home when i heard that news
yeah
the hispanic part of l._a. pretty well
but you you got the you got the three fifty in the van
i don't know diesels got pretty unpopular and you couldn't sell the thing i mean though for what you could get for one you might as well drive it over a cliff and uh the injector pump went bad so i
[noise]
here it's like it's like a dollar five yeah
um-hum
um-hum
for you know uh nothing i mean it was they're they still don't know what they were there for
that we don't get fixed
so well have a good day and i appreciate the conversation
oh um-hum
isn't it amazing
uh it's just below hot springs
you don't
[noise]
are you are you how about that well we're all lots of people from t._i. up this way
well that's where we that's where i am plano
uh-huh
yeah they they're always branded you know as a bunch of outlaws [laughter] if their if their
uh-huh
uh-huh
come to a decisive answer
i think tha- so they want to you know try an- i think they're trying i think tha- i think that most of the politicians understand this
so she works with in in in sales
you know having the time when you have younger ones to take care of
oh well he made it at fifty [laughter] it was a magic number for him and and uh he went at fifty and he still works part time at other thing you know
yeah
which was about all i wanted to understand
uh
uh-huh
black police officer to the cast so it's interesting how they kind of got away from the or- i guess the premise of the movie as well was the problems that that uh
whether they decided to do away with the the racial problem as the main thrust of it or whether they were going to show that eventually that would die down somewhat that um
oh i'm i'm consulting right now i'm in between jobs so it makes uh it makes a difference i'm i'm interested in many more industries than i used to be just in terms of looking around so it
[noise] yeah it seems like they're not really trying to report the news they are trying to report how the news affects them
they didn't
um-hum
yeah we were saying we could sell our house here and buy one down there cash you know
so but there was one thing that he couldn't stand and that was soybeans i tried it like once or twice and he just could not eat it so i never i had i was limited i had to make vegetarian meals without using soybeans but
[laughter] let me tell you you go without a lot of things that you wou- you know
i don-
yeah i think that's what it is i'm not either
um-hum
uh-huh
i'll switch over to birds you know we we don't really have birds as pets but we sure because we have cats
well we went over and we rode their horses and everything but and and just listened to the stories and the money
okay so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at they'd in austin texas university of texas
oh wonderful
and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner
um-hum
that's true
uh-huh
i see are you from the where are you from
and i know that i'm drawing a lot on what i learned in school you know i i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on on -earned but um
so we're making all kinds of cuts in college
overloaded
ways
to just be home with the baby she has to have you know something else she's always been one who's put in
well i'm i'm sure i'm sure given given all your training i'm sure that
well there's
you know
back in roosevelt's administration they had the c._c._c. camps
i'm not sure who started the national
so they just don't bother to put them in in all of them [laughter]
now when you say you -tu- returned it to a different store did you take it just to a different location of the same store or just another
offered that our forefathers wouldn't have even crossed their brains to have expected you know a dishwasher or a disposal or uh uh
you know something i do when i marinate steak that you might think is interesting i have a tupperware uh sealed or any plastic sealed and then i just turn it over every once in awhile
oh yeah
that's right [laughter] that's right [laughter] oh gosh well it's it's a real problem i'm sure
-kay bye-bye
by doing something incorrectly because they were
and we will continue funding you for the next two years after two years we're cut it down seven- to seventy fi- you know seventy five percent [noise] and after another year we'll cut it fifty percent and in five years
[noise]
yeah well
then i would do it you know everyday or two days so i would clean that pan very very rarely and so it wasn't so bad well she had two cats and just as easy it just never started smelling i would put just a little bit of cat litter there
oh yeah you see all these people yeah these stately people and well dressed people out walking their dogs with their plastic bag or their piece of paper for them it's really kind of funny
yeah
um-hum
multistorey is what they call them
uh-huh
how did you all get tied up with this uh t._i. system
yeah yeah
uh-huh
different set of instructors on it and a little different outlook and plus there are regional differences i think too california may have a different
good good well hasn't been a long time [vocalized-noise] t._i. or i i'm
what kind of time frame is it uh looking for the uh different shifts up there
yeah
we killed about a an hour or so doing that because it was about an hour and a half wait to get into the restaurant and uh then about thirty minutes worth of a meal or so thirty or forty five minutes there and then
there's a lot that are moderately priced also whether you're in the suburbs or go downtown so there's there's quite a selection in this area
right
um-hum
uh yeah
because dairies they don't th- th- it's not like it was a big ranch where they let the cow roam around free they've got to have them there to be able to milk them and they and i read in this article i couldn't believe it where you know like one cow produces like
right yeah
as far as you know
you know
what can be recycled as what
he hasn't come back because like i said he's never gone away like this before and
yeah it jus-
uh-huh yeah
okay
it's it's probably gotten just a little bit too warm now we have trouble up here with uh uh
uh-huh
right
um
it's just an eyesore i think with all the
no hm th-
[noise] excuse me
but they are amazing
right
apparently it's very very dangerous situation
and uh
uh-huh
okay we live i live in sherman so i'm not sure if i'll i can receive that station or not but i will try and i'll you know listen for a while
and that was okay but i liked his early stuff a lot better
and this is money that she's borrowed t- for her college education
more like a side show than anything else and that's sad but i don't think there's any way you could go uh the peace corps could go in and rescue those people and i th- don't think you could have done it fifty or a hundred years ago either
yeah
and it's called a user boards or slots is what it's called
and you get satisfaction out of it and
yeah no i think this is a i think this is maybe a name brand and i suspect that it's probably just a fluke you know i have the papers and everything and we're going to get just take it back but uh
and that's probably not a chain restaurant
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
with high prices and seven courses isn't what i usually look for
[laughter]
seem to have the attitude like you're going into their home for dinner almost
[noise] and
drive drive up to i think it's about
well it has all all the way through history there's uh i guess if you want to call it mysticism or the occult or whatever it's always fascinat- i guess because we don't know and there's no real way of finding out well there's only one way of finding out
and that's pretty good actually
um-hum
i th-
[noise]
um-hum
no well i don't know maybe you will but uh you know uh it it it just doesn't translate there is no melody
uh-huh i u- i understand the university of texas has a huge winery down in south texas some place really big one
never came back huh oh well [noise] m- all my family's in california i just i don't know i just couldn't stand being away from texas i kept coming back
um-hum
yeah it was like we were all sitting here going what just happened i'd say if y- if if you if you weren't watching it was like boom you missed it and it's like next thing you know they're all just looking down the shaft going you know what happened
every now and then they'll surprise you and have a moral to it and they do the right thing [laughter]
um-hum
sometimes you don't like to see the mirrors on the wall you don't like to see how you work but i guess sometimes it kind of motivates you to really get going but
that's right
okay i guess we're on the air now
fo- it and and i notice theirs doesn't cut in much below fifty cents i think
i know well you can't deduct for credit card interest that type of thing
yeah
uh i had a little bit of experience with it and also i noticed in canada they uh you drop a a quarter fifty cents whatever in a
[noise]
points yeah so
no one was uh blackfoot and one was cherokee
yeah this is going to roll right off my si- [noise]
do you
and all the girls were crying when they walked out and all the guys were just kind of staring straight ahead like that didn't bother me and you know it did
hum
and um so i don't know i mean i don- i don't want to disagree with you i i
how fun oh that's great oh you d- fifteen thousand singles oh i ca- i have like uh
um
well
uh
you know labor is to to take care of the crops
you know that built-in kind of security
i am not very
i see they've gotten a little narrow-minded about things like that [laughter]
no but i don't think uh i don't think it's right for somebody to uh for me to to uh pay for something i mean the w- the way it is right now the prisons are overcrowded
uh-huh
there you go
yeah see what they
not in the spring
here hang on just a second i've got a los angeles map let me just quick
and just seem like we were getting a lot of rain in march but i you have to it's hard to remember twelve months ago what it was like but i guess yeah i wish i just wish it wouldn't come all at once [laughter] and i- and
area where the cowboys have their training camp or used to anyways
yes that's i'm starting to realize that i never really thought about that much but there is
so
just because it only takes a few minutes to cook you know you get it ready you have to do a lot of work beforehand i agree and buy special stuff but uh
if i if i fry them throw them in there i will
uh-huh
uh-huh
drunken driving and um
life in life without parole is not the stiffer pen- penalty than the death penalty
yeah yeah i wouldn't want to be se- sequestered for a week and be locked up in a hotel or a motel or hotel or whatever
um-hum
um
okay [laughter]
and uh my discover card i have no annual fee and my mom like i started using mine and i told my mom about it
oh really wow
yeah
yeah
uh rehabilitation programs of some sort something to get to to put these people back in society but prepare them first
all right well it was nice talking to you
and there's not anything she can do to keep them in you know if they meet certain guidelines
uh-huh
uh-huh
and i know it was after seventy eight because we built our home here in seventy eight and it was a new development that didn't have any trees yet so we had electricity and we had fifteen people camped out on our floor in sleeping bags
i didn't see it
um-hum
uh-huh
mischievous deeds going on in my neighborhood
[laughter] well that's interesting that you say that because i am too my my sadness with it occurs that it doesn't seem to be consistent
yeah
she uh you know and she was still [noise]
and people say well you know they're a nursing home but the hey it doesn't work that way they're a business
yeah
so i don't know who's the victim there i mean the kids are the victim it seems like a lot of times the women are victims because they're addicted and [noise]
oh those people yeah
um you know you uh my job is not the most thrilling in the world and uh i enjoy laughing and uh some of the shows that
yeah
uh-huh
so dow- now we're down to two and two
my goodness
so you can learn the basics you know
ju- just just by not knowing you know how to get to that that one bolt or that one screw or whatever to get things apart
uh-huh
um-hum
so
that's the way i and i believe you me it wasn't easy to give up to give up a hamburger that that was one of my favorite foods was was a was a good steak or a hamburger but
[laughter]
um
uh-huh
um-hum
but it
yeah well this is football country down here
yeah
[noise]
have you tried oat bran
uh-huh
did i have to train her
right
well i guess you better push one
well uh
oh yeah
you played football for north carolina
right
about two years yeah i see how long it be before you're ready to buy another one
yeah so
yeah well i don't want to see it
yeah yeah well i've never had it had to have one in the city you know when i was in the country we used them and out there was a necessity i mean you don't kill a copperhead with a rock
[noise]
yeah
yeah
and are all the kids into the simpsons
and a lot of those it comes with a bigger engine and the things like that but uh
huh
automatic transmission cruise control you know electric locks you know it's like it's like a luxury car except that it's the dodge aries you know so uh
uh actually i'm a red sox fan more than anything yeah
there was uh i understand there was a really good basketball boo- book called uh a. season on the brink
oh i love the mud hens they're great i love the name and there was a b- really big article on the mud hens in sports illustrated last year
i'll have to tell my son about that i'm sure he'd like it
right
oh yeah yeah
uh-huh
yeah and we this house was new when we bought it and it's all white walls and so we put up some wallpaper and some drapes and you know but we just never got we didn't have the money we didn't have the time to really decorate it
uh-huh where
well uh well are prices holding you know you be able to get what you've got in that house you think
i've been there thirty two years
um-hum
and i always felt that it wasn't a religious motive that gave us good friday the the the employees voted for good friday it was just that new years day to memorial day was such a long stretch without a holiday it was nice to put one in there in the spring
uh-huh
um oh well [laughter] i guess that i really don't know that much
don't go out there and start digging holes uh
it is wide open uh and flat
um-hum
[noise] i think you're you're going to find that just because the united states you know there is such a demand here the market you know and uh
well it seems to me that kids that a- get out of high school that parents have gone to college and college here and college there that are really not interested in going to college and forced into it
um-hum
and you know they're just extremely bright kids and also they value learning
yeah well you have a lot of discipline i uh
uh-huh
and i think they're getting ready to to probably sell us out our division
the last was back down to lubbock to visit parents
very interesting
real well of course you haven't lived until you have been to san antone to the uh to the alamo and take
yeah yeah
to work
i- i hear it's excellent and it's probably something i'd i'd enjoy but i- i heard that it was so uh kind of gruesome in scenes that that and that was the part i probably wouldn't like but i heard that uh the acting was was great and it was a really thrilling movie
star value i don't really go see movies because it's like robert redford was in havana and and boy that looked like a bad movie just in the coming attractions and i said and i said boy
oh was it yeah
you die before yeah something like that
i really didn't i was so shocked
uh-huh
okay our topic for today is invasion of privacy so i got a good one
there were people
[laughter]
well the w._r. grace uh was put in charge of a commission to find government waste uh i guess this is about eight or ten years ago now and he came out with a whole book
oh okay okay that'll work okay let me hit one now
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah the where where i work they just started a paper drive and in fact everybody has two trash cans
kind of a government administrative health insurance or medical plan because i just feel like everything the government takes over is just going to be run much poorly and it's going to be about six times more expensive as what
[vocalized-noise] well i guess it has a lot to do with a lot of the stuff that i find out that i'm paying for now you know
oh yeah
um
yeah yeah i agree
the thing i don't like about a lot of these court trials and a lot of these appeals is that it's not based on what is true and what is false but rather it's on the rules of evidence what can i hide and what do i have to tell
-kay
that's funny
if i write a check real large it'll go ahead and pull it out of my savings account
and the doctor has had me on medication and she doesn't want me to walk she said that's you know while it's healing you're going to mess it up so i can't walk
and we live on one of those blocks that it's a neighborhood watch block we all know each other and the street doesn't go anywhere
uh i i can't say i really enjoyed it all that much but once i got used to it
uh-huh
also i don't know the level of the teachers today are they dedicated like they used to be years ago or is it just a [noise] it's just a job so they can get the summers off
or [vocalized-noise] even his you know presenting material in years you can get the notes off someone else and never go to class and just go for your midterm and final and as long as you study those notes from two years ago you're still going to do fine in his class
no but it's a start i think i think what you i guess you have to look at things almost just like the i guess the like the pro life and pro choice is that you start with something and if you accomplish it then you increase your objectives and and you move to the next
right
yes
i do want to keep up and know what's going on and
i'm either gonna read it or i'm gonna hear it that they can turn right around and use in a report
right you're absolutely right that's a good one
yeah
and they then t._i. paid me that
um-hum
right
uh or maybe just because you know there's there's a lot more flat lands you know out in the west so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
i don't know i just have more confidence in them for some reason
yeah
ye- maybe pediatricians although that i i could split on i i think i have some i know some good males
but um as for
my father had uh i keep talking about my father because he owned a house um
you think uh-huh uh-huh
no no not at all in fact uh we we talked about that just a little bit you know we were joking around about uh
yes he's commuting it's um about
right
that's wonderful how is it now i imagine you said he's a sophomore
oh really
is this one of your favorite topics
well you know in virginia well they they do eat the rock bass though
um
bye night bye-bye
not look happy
but it's nice having a dog here uh the
getting in yeah
exactly you know wha- what they uh oh another thing is that it th- industry has got to get the mind set that what they'd do affects the uni- you know th- affects the environment
somehow that doesn't surprise me [laughter]
sure
well i've heard it said that that's one of the reasons why we're not as much a threat to be attacked by other countries because everybody and his brother's got a gun at home
people just don't see those as individual lives somehow or they don't they don't uh relate to them personally
yeah or else we or else we know about it now one or the other [laughter]
okay
more smart things that are very damaging getting in getting out uh making end runs allowing more creativity at the lower echelon levels for people to slip in slip out and do things
um-hum
and uh we bought a uh we lived in the philippines for t._i. in eighty five eighty six and eighty seven and we bought a uh ford telstar which is somewhat similar to the taurus it's sold in the in uh the far eastern coun- far east countries more
yeah
well i'd i now i have a problem with this too i think our courts have too many opportunities for them to go back and get one more chance
well i think texas has a good good law uh crimes murders related with uh drugs or killing a policemen
uh-huh
and that's that's what they're not doing now
oh okay yep
uh-huh uh-huh
but it's far enough away we have fields around it
all five of us into and if you if you know anything about teenagers it's kind of hard to get them to sit together for any amount of time
jeez
but uh next year we'll probably buy a new car and we're looking at uh possibly the honda accord
um a four year old car
[laughter] golf clock
yes yes um-hum
um
thank you bye
right
instead of discourage it instead of giving you a break so that maybe a wife could stay home and do
hum
i- i agree with you that i think someone needs to do it that's important
and when you go to a bar it's usually so loud or so crowded that you even that you can't talk to anybody
well i'm fifteen so [laughter]
um-hum
yes
in the in a matter of a year and a half we've we've been managed to save it's going to be almost enough to pay for our entire wedding you know and we're talking five or six thousand dollars saving in a year and a half
right it yeah you you have to i think that's the the a good idea for both you know both parties to know what the finances are
now i figure th- uh anybody that is dumb enough to iron
within within the schools themselves
[laughter]
[noise]
you know education's wasted on the youth anyway you don't you don't really appreciate it until you're much older anyway i know when i went to school
gosh we haven't done anything uh real major
have you it's uh pollen season i guess
okay
um-hum
yep [noise]
only problem is you can't get anything in the paper sack [laughter]
it's a totally gas fired operation they say there's no exhaust whatsoever you know most people think of tire yeah those burning tire uh
uh-huh
and uh maybe in a older plastered house this wouldn't uh this would be too often but i think i think with the drywall they use now the plaster board really seems to soak in the paint
really have you served on a jury
kind of like the referee [laughter]
but uh if everyone would take it i think if everyone took it seriously
but it just there just more of them there still than there are other places the rest of us are kind of strung around some but we- but you know if you if you're talking about convenient for the biggest majority it still is there
uh-huh
it's yeah it seems that happened with their family
where
yeah i was real hesitant but it was
and that was a move in the right direction we are doing some things to try to correct the problem but there are more things we could do and getting rid of old cars like i said is one way to help correct the problem
to my air conditioner and you know my head and my f- i'm so stopped up right now i don't know if it's uh if it's partly from what's blooming you know right now pollen and stuff like that that's part of it but um
and [noise] i'm sure that uh as an undeveloped country they look look for it but there is not exactly a lot of uh physical responsibility there
argentine beef yeah yeah
you know
uh i- i don't i think that it should be i mean if it's beyond a doubt that someone did premeditate someone a murder then i think you know that they should likewise you know someone should take their life also but uh
would be the ones where i think that capital punishment would be necessary to keep that person from perhaps uh doing it again and even more so to get people on the outside who are professionals to realize that
oh okay [noise] i don't think i really know that
our step daughter's ten now
or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care
[laughter]
uh-huh
oh okay i just have it pay somebody to get into the buildings
oh
we were down we well when we came back from the outer banks we came up due norfork and spent a night there with a friend in portsmith and then went to williamsburg and spent a night
uh-huh [laughter]
uh-huh
a lot a lot of people that are in jail you know it's their first shooting or why do people you know not everybody has shot someone before
it's the people using the guns
as you know uh john lennon was you know you know was shot and killed
you such um seriously and
sometimes i wish i were strong as a man but um or the average man anyway
no huh-uh
uh-huh
that'll be me too and my family they'll go oh my god you've got children are you fixing to have a child they won't believe it they'll pass
what what kind of testing do they do when you went
you know secretaries aren't aren't really going to cost the company that much money if they fall face forward in their typewriter or something so
oh
yes
and uh
ohio and where are you now
maybe [laughter]
lafayette
uh-huh
oh wow
i can see the results of that
i would like to see more
right
[laughter]
no i did years ago for seventeen years i worked uh in fort worth at a a landing gear company menasco
if the other person doesn't
strapped with everything
well that's only fair because the reason i'm a [vocalized-noise]
but uh they call me i sent them a copy of the divorce decree and told them i refuse to pay it
yeah
you should cut it off
[laughter]
[noise]
and
but
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
oh okay but i'm wondering how many women actually major in engineering act- but you know i say that but yet i know two
one of those things that you know seems to happen
none of the above [laughter] i think they are extremely well qualified
oh
huh
like i i would really like to be a teacher
right
to brighten up your life oh it's just amazing um but he can't say anything he can just kind of make noises you know
so
but uh it's a little heavy for lunch
uh-huh
yeah i ca- understand that
uh-huh
but uh
you know regimes that are in there
you know i just find myself lacking in in a lot of knowledge about south america [vocalized-noise]
i've often wondered if that does have something to do with the the climate being uh so warm that it tends to make work harder to do
i don't know we've got we had one of those blow through tonight
that's nice
oh gosh
yeah good luck to you okay we'll see you um bye
so um
but i'm not for sure that we're we're not destined at least for
that's awful um uh howard and i were talking about home repair the other night in uh in connection with scouting you got a scouter uh coming up and uh
uh-huh
and uh that was what considered typical for that area
that's right it's healthy why not
the only thing that saves it with the schedule i work and the schedule my wife works we're getting ready to go to work at di- totally different times
that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now
and uh my husband and i we have entered a few rallies that's pretty popular in texas i don't know if it's up north but
i'll have to remember that that'd be really interesting my husband wants to go into med school and be a neurosurgeon so he's really interested in the heart
yeah
yeah
[noise]
um-hum
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh i think that would've been a much smarter way to handle it and the another thing that would've helped a lot would be to make certain that [noise] the people who were going to use the money
consistently voted it down and since they do enough damage every two years think of where we'd be if we let them meet yearly
reimbursing this is going to be a substantial cost the banks are failing because of all their
you have the seven day waiting period
but they would vote pro-choice
um-hum
oh i wouldn't wear slacks to work
uh is that a factor
your work without saying much about it do they ever bring the subject up of asking your opinion on on whether you want things to change on how you dress or
well i was just reading an article in uh
on your friends that's true [laughter] that's true [laughter] well we have so many unexpected things come up so often it seems with we both have older cars and something will come up and we'll end up having to spend a thousand dollars you know on the car in two months or something and
uh-huh uh-huh
the abilities in the future will be networking throughout uh automatic built-in telephone
does it
yeah
and and a big percentage of that was expended as well that [vocalized-noise] that w- that was just a matter of
well what what what they've been able to do is slow down the rate of increase
um-hum um-hum in fact i my mother who is eighty six years old canned over a hundred quarts of half runners last year
because they uh look pretty and in my front garden uh but i like the vinca which is something i hadn't they look sort of like impatiens you know but they're not quite [laughter]
you know give her transportation if it's necessary and course i'd like her to live in the dorm if it's possible
trips home and
yeah yeah
let's see
looked through some of the games
i uh not married to it let's put it that way if i have a good book i would rather read it than watch t._v.
yeah right
uh-huh
huh
right well it sounds good sounds like he's doing real well
my wife works so
yeah seeing like uh in one way we're kind of lucky because they're all boys but in another way we're not so lucky because we don't have
being somewhere where we learned something instead of just sitting around watching t._v. and playing all day
oh yeah
i'd rather just be the student [laughter]
oh okay isometrics stuff like that
um-hum i haven't really started to put on a lot of weight i'm i guess i probably put on about ten nine or ten pounds since i stopped playing which was about four years ago
uh-huh
it seems like there's it seems like there's a grass roots um
it's it is that like you said the divorce rate is getting so high
but the drug agency wasn't asking for it he was asking for it you know which didn't make any sense at all
i- i think there's a lot of waste that that could uh that could be cut out
[laughter]
and uh i also like romantic novels
you know kind of off the wall if someone says do you want to do this tonight uh and i got a mountain of things to do it's okay you know we do it
yeah so do i
well how about who
yeah
does pay it doesn't pay well
huge numbers of other western states have no real welfare system
um-hum
rather than using taxed
um-hum
assure that there's some work in the private sector
start
government tooling specialist
but i i think uh if we're going to waste money i'd almost see rather see us waste it at home [laughter]
and
yeah and h-
[laughter]
i mean the the counties are much larger
and they had uh ag- they had an ag- course uh i forget what it was called uh but it goes along the the lines of industrial arts but it's [vocalized-noise] agricultural and where they had to raise a small animal
um-hum
yeah
about um appliances too um
no i- i don't know whether um
i tried to get uh when i moved i moved up here from florida and i wanted to get a uh my
i think we all probably all have all the toys now
yeah and you have to use your vacation pay for that
um they have i'm not sure up to five years they have a certain number of days and after five years they have um unlimited uh personal time off but
yeah it teaches people to think of the future i think
oh yeah
[laughter]
uh-huh
and uh
um-hum
you know mainly window shopping but um we've been thinking more american just
the majority of people that live in this area go into dallas to work and and
uh-huh
um
but um
um-hum
um-hum
in the in uh a way of like self-gratification today
yeah
uh-huh
uh-huh
yeah
um-hum
um-hum
and um i'm not sure which i like better it's kind of nice to be on flat land but
for a while they built a a run for him out to the side of the house you know he'd been on the patio but they put the run out there and he didn't like this run because there were no people that came by
i don't know i- i- i think that um my husband and i are in such a situation that uh um i'm kind of um not able to do a lot i'm i'm kind of in a wheelchair and i mean i kind of am but um
because that was like what he was used to
and uh i'll steam those just after just when the potatoes are about done i'll put those in there with it and steam those with them at the same time
they're kind of like rotel but uh i can't remember their what brand they are they're
i love mushrooms just about any way
they're peeled
finance well my husband is a financial person
yes
yeah well see um i'm i'm a cool person they call they and the- i think that's relates to the same thing as the winter
yes that's true uh-huh
um and it would certainly be nice if the various um republics seceded
and so i think just from that there's going to be some limited amounts of disarmament they'll still be republics with the missiles the ones that are under the firmer control of the of the soviets
uh yeah yeah until i just finally had to say
you know
right
oh gosh
yeah
is it a diesel
uh-huh
[noise]
um-hum
oh okay well then i can tell you that roles have changed i'm thirty eight [laughter] and they've changed quite a bit um
oh it is
yeah adventure yeah uh some of that gets i don't know i think they've got ghost writers now on a lot of them and uh they just put their name to it because years ago either that or my tastes are changing um
you know like uh [noise] uh rain fish
yeah
well fortunately ours was on the ceiling where they had the blow in ceiling the little uh
that's that's something um yeah we have it's a very timely subject i think in the spring everybody decides that they're going to start over and do something with their house
i got you covered there
they're not doing much down here though
i haven't not until this year it's really starting to
but used to you know if i had a torn sack when i got home i just trashed it you know and anymore i don't do that i'll put it in with the paper recycling you know the newspaper or something
[laughter] so it was unsatisfactory completely [laughter]
you could really go a long ways to alleviating some of the problems that people have
that's right
[noise]
yeah yeah
the thing about the child care i
i don't know i- i- i have to admit i was a self- i was selfish as a child i didn't want a brother or sister and now that i'm older of course it's different you know i think about uh wouldn't it be nice but uh anyway
well i've been finding out that i really am a nice person but it's been hidden for many years
like baby sitters raising the kids and things like that i guess
oh
yeah
uh i guess decisive about that just the fact that you kn- if since i don't use drugs i have no problem with taking a test
um-hum
yeah that's uh you know it it it it could blow things right away for them you know unless they say well look i mean unless they walk it won't
[laughter]
well we just ate out um had a big lunch actually because we both have been working late and we had italian um have you ever been to the olive garden
right that's all
and uh it cost me oh fifteen hundred dollars i guess to build it
right but uh
uh-huh
have money put into the house budget
yeah fine you have to um do some of those things and and when money is involved it can really get expensive
so i think if parents don't provide it's it's not going to be there
uh you know you name anything that's ever happened to you is going to be tied into either your social security number or your driver's license
uh-huh
okay
and i'm trying to figure out how how to feed him so he'll eat this stuff [laughter] and the kids will eat it too and it's not going to be fattening high in fat or high in cholesterol
it can still be pink in the middle and that makes all the world of difference
and uh i use to have to go over to patterson when those riots were going on at sometimes um
right it's not so much that they come to you every minute but it's that you are there when they need you
uh-huh uh-huh
and your name was
uh-huh
bye-bye
and that seems to so wok food seems to be our our thing
um-hum
that's uh some pretty good ideas why don't you do something with those [laughter]
oh yeah
i i mean you know the typical three networks i um i do watch a lot of c._n._n. stuff and and uh uh i'm home most of the time so
okay i-
so yeah exactly uh
you were he was waiting for what again
and uh i'm trying to think what else i watch on television sportswise i like i like tennis so i mean i'm not i haven't played in years but um i just like to watch you know two two players really get go at it on television
[laughter]
well sounds like you're from up north yeah
uh-huh
right well you can do that with say a mortgage payment but they charge so many points in order to refinance a lot of people can't afford that
yeah
is a lot of that going on
ours are those too yeah you must live in an older home too then
had uh
um-hum
you know which really wasn't our fault i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
yeah [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh
you do
[laughter]
in my day we talked quietly behind our hands about people that we suspected might be sleeping with their boyfriends
kids would walk around with a._m.
and uh especially come home every couple months
shot the people and uh return offenders have
well what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty
you
yeah i think uh you probably just need to make sure that it dries very very carefu- uh well before she lets her cats out or something like that
oh my word
yes [laughter]
like golf or whatever i mean there are other things that you could go do [noise] so uh i i don't see the the
people in general the the the
ye- yes i think we're terribly taxed i- i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other uh
i- i think that's a wide open subject what i think that uh people need to take a stand i think the people will here shortly uh
and uh there really needs to be a bridge some sort of transition
yeah
oh my goodness i can't you tell me first because i can't think right now
uh let's see i don't remember whether cheers no i don't think so you mean christie
but uh [noise] it's sung by the herb alpert congregation
oh okay this was a comedy so it probably wouldn't be the same one
um-hum
yeah that's right
um
and um and then um
oh my goodness
um i lived in louisville kentucky for a while i- i lived on the outskirts too but louisville was pretty ba- especially during like the uh
[noise]
make decisions
and so i'm sort of facing putting them through college about the time i'm also looking to retire
right
uh you know the math and the the english and a little science and stuff like that
[laughter] i'm reading uh within the plantation household which is a history uh sort of a sociological history of southern women black and white living on plantations
oh boy well um i haven't been doing a whole lot of reading for enjoyment lately i read uh one book a friend recommended to me i can't even remember the guy's name it was a science fiction dean
um he started out with one called the family which does the family systems and people's roles in the family and then he did uh hea- healing the shame that binds you
but the bahama one was nice and if that's one of the cruise we can get on i i'll take it again because it was really a lot of fun
went from tahoe to over to their house so and he knows that i i never have gone there so
um-hum
uh-huh that's wonderful
the educational the teachers the um
and you come upon something that you're totally unprepared for uh the first i had gone to a very uh
yeah
people who neglect to do that are going to pay for it
uh-huh
yeah
[noise]
uh uh-huh
yeah
it was a lot of fun i- i enjoyed that
we don't like the bar atmosphere
well i- i yeah i definitely disagree with that
what is the policy at t._i. do you have to be drug tested or
oh really
right
right
um-hum
oh my goodness you were fortunate yeah
um it's just
that's about right [laughter]
yeah she she looks like she might be an outdoors person eventually but
yeah it seems like it we need a van or something to get i mean even with if we take the dog forget it there's no room for anything else
in sunnyvale
oh yeah well sort of yeah [laughter] just a little bit i was going to ask you if if you knew now the the time spent with your children
i think that's very realistic
you know the the mom stayed home you know and raised the kids my mom didn't go back to work until i was in junior high school
um kind of regretful i think [noise]
sure is um
yeah usuall- usually when that happens and i mean it always seems to go the way of the ref's call though it never seems to go the way of you know either the coach or somebody protesting um
yeah now that it's uh well i think a lot went out of it when they had the strike too [noise]
[noise]
yeah
natural history museums and zoos and all of those things that one does with kids uh
yeah
and i come back it's rained quite a bit while we're gone i can hardly find the house [laughter]
it helps though it helps the value your property
and i can just lay there and just just watch one come past the the roof line of the people across the [vocalized-noise] street from me and uh just like seem like every two seconds i'll see them come in from about you know nine o'clock to ten fifteen they're just streaming in
[laughter] [noise]
basketball's gotten to be a lot of fun
i figured
uh-huh
uh for dallas uh my mind went blank i can picture his face
uh kind of like the oakland raiders used to be the real bad team and they were they were mean and we had so many penalties and it gets really you just really get ticked off
i liked uh
that's r- y- that's right that's right um there was just one out there was just one out well i- it wasn't out it was uh
it's about a disease that that caused people to go into like
uh-huh let me ask you a question uh while we're talking about the c._p._a. women uh in uh a firm say do you think uh a woman c._p._a. gets paid equally to a man
and uh i know quite a few women c._p._a.'s you know that are out working on their own running their own accounting practice and doing quite well
that's right yeah
really bad mayor and then in uh brought in a yeah and then came a woman that's um she's big in the democratic party
uh her husband is in the m- navy and he's stationed at bethesda and
yeah
yeah yeah
oh uh-huh
through the united states and stop and see people i know and visit for a day and then go on and you know
uh-huh
it was nice talking to you too beth
yeah
uh-huh
hum-um
incentive
oh you haven't
what [noise] if some of the newspaper articles or the i don't trust t._v. as much but newspaper articles can show wheth- how they voted in the past
i just thought he was really inept i don't think he did anything at all he they just kind of sat him up there like a puppet and the people that were
yeah and she played in uh narrow margin which was a little more recent
uh
anyway the ba- the premise of the story is that uh uh
but um
you know i haven't been to a gr- an opening for oh you know ages
uh
um-hum
which you know i thought texas would be the last place to ever
and uh you know contenders uh he might have uh did he go straight from boston to portland or did he hit another team on the way
well m- probably the one that plays here [vocalized-noise]
yeah that's true that's true
so it wasn't hooked very well but you know i got it that far i figured that uh
uh-huh
oh yeah i remember those yeah
yeah that's true i i don't know it just seems like uh you know for what we've put into it i feel like that's something that might retain it's value a little bit more than you know yeah yeah
are they still are what they're what they have out for like the next year is everything still pretty square it seems like the cadillacs is one of the few makers that are still making really i i can't think of a car that they make are the than maybe the [vocalized-noise]
we we have out here uh up until just this last year in on you are town there wasn't any really good way they had some bends around that we could find and put them in but
and my ap- [noise] facilities there it is hold on
yeah [laughter]
anyway that's when we lived in oklahoma and uh
you too bye
oh yeah
okay
right
well it's it's not taken on there as well although the young people i work in the school system so
is it that's good
[laughter] you would not only would you not want to be a victim you wouldn't want to be a criminal either
[laughter]
and then after they're they're in there a while you have to play the good old boy network
and i think that's part of the problem why people don't vote anymore because of of it's just out of people's hands and they say one vote means a lot but
this is one of the things that you know formed my opinion on poli- politicians he sat there and promised you know the next day we're going to take you up and get you registered to vote and you're going to vote for me and blah blah blah but then he never showed up
i use them mostly for big things like maybe sometimes uh
right
uh you know one of our one of our big investments that you know was i was wholeheartedly in favor of was to buy a sewing machine because she makes clothes and you know a descent sewing machine will really help her out and and she's already made you know presents and gifts and things
oh really because of the heavy ice
[vocalized-noise] always soft [vocalized-noise] you know uh so so that's helpful
[noise] yeah that's true
um-hum
um-hum
but and this is uh one group of books i'm wondering if you've read that i i guess i started reading them two or three years ago by jean auel uh the first one was clan of the cave bear
were getting rid of all their paper backs that they've read in the last few years and i they were going to take them down to the
artificial intelligence
i mean yeah more money actually um or flex time or something that was a little more personal you know
um-hum
uh-huh
common problem common prob-
yeah
you know so that that was pretty scary but we i talked to one woman and
and i guess i get some kinds of
yeah exactly
i don't know if that was a
wow
well of course
uh-huh
well uh i have to tell you a comment that the man whose office is next door to mine goes to a lot of movies and uh he will come back with his capsule review and he said
but um uh we have teenagers and we have we have a guideline i shan't say rule [laughter] that uh you know we like to see the movies that they want to see first
yeah and there's
yeah that's a that's a little of a work load
get you know a a horrible sentence for
yeah and then they get out for good behavior you know and that makes but see i don't care what they say i think the death penalty is a deterrent to some t- t- to some extent and you know
yeah
at least you got a chance to outrun them that way
almo- almost as bad as being an alcoholic can't quit smoking
yes
um-hum
uh-huh
benning- no bennington no that's in
uh for christmas or thanksgiving whichever one they're with us and uh i think the two [noise] that have been the biggest hits
if hum
had so uh i need to try a few more recipes and [laughter] but you're right anybody that tastes it even the mild they are so surprised that it's uh that spicy
yeah
well that's something that that's worthwhile checking into then because i
uh-huh
so maybe that covers the topic then
yeah i like high school football which a- again i- is not the subject but that's so much fun to watch because th- they're the the pure amateurs you know and there's no money involved you go to college you don't really know i- it loses it somewhere
um-hum
uh-huh
the relationship you get the degree with the big name on it but you know you don't build that there's a lot of learning that you don't get
and um i don't know exactly how we're gonna cover many of these people because i'm sure that some of them uh don't uh don't have the wherewithal to do it themselves so uh i- i have a feeling since i have
okay
no i don't want one i've had one before
n- not stained glass but you know i i don't know what bevelled glass right or frosted is that common in your area
oh that sounds nice
most of them don't ever want to go back to mexico especially the way it was then
and i- if they h- if they have jobs you know i i hear the story about they're taking away american jobs but i don't know
i don't know how much immigration we have from europe and everything what the controls are
s- so well
they're just horrid so we read the
what did you say you did again a com- a da-
uh-huh
and
my truck sort of puts me as a uh a- as a baltimore baltimore suburbanite i think is more uh you know i uh when i bought the truck i was going to buy a boat
no we well we're uh just recently married in december
[laughter]
no kidding
oh
so do i and a lot of times we'll go to rent a movie or something and and you're not sure h-
okay i've heard about that but i can't remember it
[laughter] i no i haven't seen it yet see we got t-
and uh we could let it out and fly around the house a little bit
well i live right around here
yeah that's what i think too i don't know how you feel um we moved here from another state we've lived here before went out and came back and that particular state had an occupational income tax but no sales tax
if both of the both of the spouses work then you get a tax credit for that um-hum
and and so one of the things i do is donate money to his campaigns and uh write to him when i see things that outrage me
right
sure
um-hum um-hum
um-hum
i yeah i have i've learned a lot from it um i've learned that credit cards are extremely dangerous in my hand [laughter]
yeah it's it's going to it's going to take quite a while um hopefully within five years we'll be in our own home
well my husband's cholesterol is not real high but he his father had uh an early heart attack and so he is very conscious of his
yeah
yeah
but of course there are many private engineering schools that are absolutely superb
yeah i agree uh i- and and it would uh would be nice if we could get some uh some multiple use out of this you know maybe uh
yeah
but you know if we don't cut some of these nationwide you know some of these expenses just have to be cut if we don't need such a large army and we don't need if the military comes out and says we don't need all these planes
some of the yards
that's it they just keep
oh okay i know where that is
oh okay
[laughter] uh-huh [laughter]
three four bedrooms and a sewing room and a junk room [laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
it's sort of like being a scab i guess in a sense but uh but i used you know i mean he did a wonderful job so i just went back and said wonderful things about him you know but we went and part of it was test driving a range rover and i realized afterward you know it's a real nice ride because it's nice you're nice and high
or southwest
but uh
have no talents
um-hum
um-hum
you know would you give in
right he he they let him out and then and then he wa- he wasn't allowed back in the town where he had done this so he came to our he came to rochester instead and they they they realized later he he'd killed about between eleven and twelve women at least
you know bombarded by all the other eleven jurors
yeah
um-hum
yeah i- i understand that
[noise]
well i- i- i should imagine the lower grades what would what what's what's certainly drawn everyone's attention to that
yeah
um-hum
so i would assume distance swimming might be similar that and he was good at distance splits as a swimmer you know at i can remember that but the distance um [noise]
the mountains yeah
so it's pretty amazing it can be that drastic in just a short distance
really assigned costs appropriately for example the real cost of a barrel of oil if you take into account pollution and all of the other side effects is probably a hundred dollars a barrel
uh-huh
um-hum
oh yeah
accreditations there too
that is the fields that you know are opening up are
and it won't take but just a you know just a quick look at a map to find
well it held our pan and you know the potatoes and stuff we had a good time
uh i spend the whole day with tara and we go and do things and we read books and we play and you know it's just it's great and i did the same thing with taylor
yeah yeah and i can choose they say as a substitute you can tell them the days that you're interested and you know the days you're not you don't have to so
sitters and how about
uh in fact i have been real disappointed in the six years that i've lived out here about lot sizes
double ceiling double high
and i'm not used to that either
won't let them stay any longer it frustrates him because they'll just be getting somebody to the point where they can really make some progress and then they're gone
if you knew that uh long term the
yeah
uh-huh i used to live in amarillo originally so i'm
um-hum
and um the the peonies have been out for now about three weeks and the roses have been blooming for two weeks and the grass is uh this lush green and of course i've got lots of weeds in mine because i don't use any poison either
decided to go with a few flowers and give up on the vegetable garden
they certainly enjoy that part of it [laughter]
it it just seems to me i don't know whether it it that's kind of a colloquium just use common sense but i- it just seems like there has to be some there will be a crisis at some point
um-hum
no they did not
oh up here they do well they're still doing it well it's just like up here we don't there's very very few times i've had to show my driver's license for to use a credit card
but tha- it it exists is what i'm saying those avenues exist
yeah
uh-huh
and um you know i- it's still it's just surrounding the city and you can actually see it there's a couple of uh tall buildings in raleigh and and you can actually you know they're blurred they're even dark and what it is is the pollution
oh gosh i think i would hate to live in california the smog there i mean i can't believe they have warnings here which it it's mainly just when it gets real real hot
oh
yeah that yeah the grubs
yeah um i i don't i'm not familiar with that pear tree uh but it's a non bearing pear is that right yeah
i do notice as i get older i- i tend to i you know i don't exercise like i like i used to
and then i'm of course i'm impelled also
yes
yeah my my schedule yeah my schedule's pretty similar i um i teach so on the days i teach i teach a couple days a week so whenever i teach i try and wear a tie
that's true a lot of those nice looking legs yeah
uh-huh
you kidding me those are real good for men to wear so
they didn't expect you to choose any sort of major or anything at all until you were
wind up spending a lot of time doing that instead
that's not even true in our colleges
um-hum um-hum
and um i'm looking forward to his schedule being flexible and to mine a- you know at some point being flexible so that we can sort of juggle our own schedules around and and create some sort of way that we can
um-hum
um-hum um-hum
uh well by by uh i make my living by uh flying airplanes for for a company and uh as a as a uh an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing
uh-huh
or was she from the young girl that uh contracted aids through her dentist allegedly and then they proved it yeah i don't i don't know um [vocalized-noise] i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general or what um
really ideal uh
that's right
yeah
uh-huh
well there is a lake not far but it is more run off from surrounding you know areas and that
yeah it's it's drier in dallas than it is in houston or san antonio or even austin which is further south but it is not dry and and i have lived here for many years and i think it has gotten more humid over the years where the water is coming from i don't know
um-hum
well credit cards um i th- think they are wonderful but um
and you've got to live that down
yeah
yeah i remember that yeah
yeah well that's how sewing i love to sew and uh i wish i had more time to do it but sometimes i'll get started on a project and then finishing it is more of a chore than [laughter]
[laughter] don't you wish you'd been able to though
yeah
yeah
well
yep
when they're feeding
like they live up in sherman it is near lake texoma
um-hum
yeah
i don't know technically we knew what we were doing either then you heard about the things like agent orange et cetera and you'd think [noise]
it's preceded by uh several other books by these guys uh wake me up when it's over was about the eighty four elections and i forget what the other books were but any case uh i- i- it's uh
right
what about what about voters in the other countries that you're talking about like in the european countries where they have higher turnouts
and then yeah very soon he was old enough to just go and sort of stay in my office and you know nobody seemed to have a big problem with that so that's an interesting issue though
um-hum
port authorities right there so he used to take the steamer down to new york and you know i mean he went
but you're right when most when most people end up in there and i hear it from a lot of elderly people their greatest fear is that they're going to end up there and nobody's going to see them [noise]
um-hum
um-hum
yeah that is right
yeah that's true yeah
um-hum
i will not let them watch that if there is a lot of language or
what channel is it on
yeah
well it's usually we go to church on sundays but we will miss every once in a while and i will let kyle watch that and he just well i even like jot i mean i it is funny
one of those things i have to learn about i do i work with kids a lot
um-hum
i don't i don't know how it is in virginia but in florida now uh uh uh at eighteen years someone was just sentenced to eighteen years i heard on today
uh
uh-huh
um-hum
well that was part of the problem with
and and then they go rob a liquor store or something
um-hum
uh
yeah
regular street
how much was the alternator
you know ge- you know i
yeah i think it's good that we do get a lot of variety in news coverage although uh t._v. networks and uh there are radio stations that uh specifically cater to the news
[vocalized-noise]
they don't even see it but i think they're being raised watching t._v. more than newspapers
yeah
oh and he hears them or something and
i do not know for sure but there are certain uh qualities that suggest it could be he because they were uh
uh if you ever get those or e-
well that and uh his business is going down the tubes so bad you know
yeah
oh that's got to be hard to go from really rich to poor [laughter]
on the plant i do not i am not sure what they are called but i do not much
okay
i think it's seven hundred fifty five families
no i haven't only to the airport
uh-huh
the superior and i was the subordinate and you know [laughter]
[vocalized-noise]
um-hum
yeah we- that's what's really great about where i live here it's in in an area that's within you know four or five blocks there must be forty restaurants i'm not kidding it's just uh
right
right
yeah
all the cool people did it
and there'll probably some be some very good systems available by the turn of the century
um
civil liberties of purs- life liberty and pursuit of happiness then taking that away
[laughter] yeah
that that helps some if it depends on what your deductible is how high it is
uh-huh
you know and it's two big cities that i think of as somewhat comparable
oh yeah he was a good golfer
as a matter of fact a friend of mine asked me if i thought i'd be interested in golf i said i don't know i'll have to try it and see i've always watched it and he said well fine he said we'll just take you over to the course he lives near brookhaven
oh yeah no my husband's pretty tolerant so he's not too bad to watch
so i mean it it's you know these things that you pamper
yeah
yeah well y- do you do your own uh lawn in terms of uh mowing
it must be the culture's different uh down there than up here also
because there will be a precedent they'll have had role models whereas you know the generation that grew up in the sixties and seventies
and then there was a man in the um parking lot and he pulled out a gun that he had in his car and he shot the the guy was that over in
like that and they're having to crime sweep
small town but still you know
when the balance is zero it doesn't help much [laughter]
have ten percent off but you got to use that credit card
hello
well i've been involved and you know what
[noise]
yeah but uh my uh like i said my my tastes r- run the range we listen to uh you know even listen to a little bit of classical type stuff my my wife uh plays the piano
um-hum
yeah
how does the word wrap work on that do you end up with very different length lines
whenever they wanted to make a change so i i've seen that as a problem
right
my so- older son he's going to be five and he's more into watching the cartoons and that kind of stuff now so
and uh so uh i we're not going to be in the market for in the near future for any new car
yeah
[noise]
uh-huh
yeah
i uh i do telemarketing
uh i sell mostly to older people which can't get it in a normal public situation
um-hum
ok- well that's about the same time as me i came down in eighty two
and so that's where i've been ever since and so i don't regret uh not going into military service
um-hum
but uh in terms of demanding it's just not caused but demanding that um
oh yeah it's quite is is the [vocalized-noise] it's really out of the norm not to find something that isn't air conditioned
you know i really did mail it in time
i and i don't under- i mean i guess i do understand the mentality of people doing it but i don't understand
yeah
oh well we had uh
so
um-hum
didn't get that far you normally just try to sell them on your uh aptitude and not you know well how much vacation do i get oh well
well i usually keep up with news by watching a._b._c. news on television and reading the papers here the local dallas morning news and then i also take the wall street journal
i don't know uh what do i want to say i wish that i was around more news it's frustrating when i don't know what's going on i feel like it's hit and miss and
you know enjoying not having that that payment every every month and but it's getting up in age uh we're trying to hold out a little while longer uh we've got a
[laughter]
yeah but yet most of the problems we hear of course maybe that's what we hear about is from organized approved day care centers
um-hum yeah yeah
well nannies have been an option uh but i know that at day care they have more of a a routine like at uh maybe in um preschool would have where they have lessons and so forth and so on
true
yeah
pretty much what we would eat anyway a light informal meal and they usually bring something a desert or a salad or whatever and uh
[laughter]
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh
[noise]
that's right that's right
yes exactly
go ahead
oh yeah i've i've already finished mine i haven't done my dishes yet my husband's on his way home so [noise] well i do we have a time limit
[noise]
oh uh-huh
[noise] that's the same way out here because um well we for example and we live fifteen miles from the beltway that surrounds washington
that's right
um you know there are political boundaries and those are man made boundaries but you know for heaven sakes that's something that's been going on for ages and
[laughter] and like [laughter] now one thing i wish i could find a a better way to do are celery sticks and carrot sticks because they love to do that and it's just really hard and if they have to work with a knife i don't like that so
yeah [vocalized-noise]
it's an eighty nine and i bought it uh
well that was one minute they hung up
i think that i would like to if i you know we all say if i could have the car i always wanted
but if i had the little read c._r._x. i guess the interior would have to be black leather and i'd have to live with that and if i got the c._r._x. it would have to have a real good sound system in it because i'd want that too
but here again the the doctor's practices in hospitals have gone become fairly sizeable businesses under themselves now uh you take a hospital uh the physical plant itself you have to pay your share of the operating of that
[noise]
yeah same with my husband it was a charge card and social security number
um-hum well how do you get your name off the junk mailing list
okay well i worked out today
i've been trying to work up to it but i can't
stepping and looking and
gotten into the swing of it so we're we're ready we go to l- we stay here ski here lake beltin
pro team that i'm fond of i usually will will sit and watch that but uh that's the
yeah
oh well see that's y- y- y- but she was probably depressed to begin with you know what i mean [vocalized-noise] yeah grumpy to begin with [laughter] [noise]
a special play a special concert uh i recently watched a tribute to three of the finest opera stars
at wha- at [noise] excuse me at what age did you
no kidding and what what did you just decide to go there or
uh-huh
[laughter]
myself
it [vocalized-noise] here he the guy had basically admitted to killing twelve girls yeah unbelievable and um
and i thought that was
yeah i'll bet he did
and that is not emphasized i recognize there's there's over crowding problems and and since we have decided to put everybody in jail that commits a crime now that that's complicated the entire process what i also think is that
yeah
um-hum
and if that doesn't work we uh our next door neighbor is a roofer and he said he would help me put in a skylight so
um-hum well that's about the way i prepare most fish
oh yeah
chicken marinara the last two times you know
okay where have you been on vacation lately
yes
[laughter]
technological advances but
so what are your thoughts on dining out
and now the red lobster i found is very nice at lunchtime
uh i think so it should be
[laughter] well it seems to be in the current situations but uh i still feel that it could be a deterrent to crime particularly with the increase of serious crime that's going on now
[laughter] yes [laughter]
i don't i don't agree with the length of the sentence though i think expediency is the answer
yeah [laughter]
yeah
right you don't sound like you're from texas originally though
love apple cake oh i love apple cake or spice cake something like that yeah yeah i really like that
yeah we've always always had southern foods but uh mother my mother is from the deep south and so she would do like the hominy and grits and stuff and i couldn't do that [laughter]
it is for for me and my age bracket
oh i see
but you'd what what it would end up it would be the same old people going so
i don't know that i just someone gave me some paints for christmas one year and i said okay i'll try this [laughter]
well to me the quilting sounds like the thing that would be
how did you find out about it
uh-huh
my god
um
yeah
kind of [laughter]
of course
um-hum
personal conversations uh
and uh we ended up going to see green card
very high up in her class and had uh gotten a job as as an instructor and they had her teaching or were starting to have her teach history for the soldiers
yeah are you are you running ragged these days
uh-huh
um-hum
either raise our taxes or or cutback on something and i don't know what to cutback on to to get to get that to get that settled and and uh
well we uh taxes
when the shoe is on the other foot and see how it
wow
uh-huh
we've had real hot weather
well we have been drenched
oh
so it's really neat that i can do that now with my niece and nephew
yeah oh yeah we we used to like to go to oh parades the circus um
you know anymore like we have we always have the baseball games to go to that the kids are in and the you know tee ball soccer stuff like that but uh after th- as they get older it's harder to find things to do together
oh you mean so that's a separate blade
yeah
right
[noise]
uh yeah
i see well that's neat
uh-huh
i was uh
do you have children
i see
it you would be better off not knowing i guess
um bye
yeah but nothing new but he had modern equipment scud launchers i mean let's get real here those are mobile missile launchers
uh the action was comfortable and of course i enjoyed those good guy bad guy type conflicts things so i enjoyed that movie after the first few minutes of gore and there were some others but they were done a little more tastefully
um-hum
oh
have you oh good yeah i haven't
yeah well same here i mean i'm a brown belt in karate at this point in time and uh and and i can't and i can't hit a golf ball [laughter] you know i
[laughter] right yeah i think those are awful [laughter] i'm sorry i just don't see the designer's
well try and think if it was a hundred dollars a square foot
right they need the nursing care and and but it's a very expensive solution
y- y- you know listen to is the fact that there are good sol- solutions both inside and outside of nursing homes it's just a matter of
the best informed person i guess but
have to change doctors but then i might need to get that
yeah
[noise]
and uh to um
oh that's great you sound like my mother who's been [vocalized-noise] well i bake pies too but my mother was always the famous pie baker in the family and she has the same the same technique i mean i guess after so many years of doing it you just kind of do it second nature
right
oh how neat
uh big warehouse kind of thing which had offices and it was sort of nondescript for a
uh-huh
like when my sister was real bad before she died uh
absolutely
that's right
yeah
uh-huh
oh
[noise]
how it would get there but you knew where it would end up
well naturally i- i like george strait and uh
[laughter] it's kind of depressing
and she really she really i- i wouldn't say it was the a great concert
yes so that often happens that way well we had um intentionally um planned to get a dog we had just moved into this house and um decided to wait a about a year and then went then we went out then and found one she was in the litter and um
[vocalized-noise] is that right
he he kind of has free run of the place and there is some- or somebody takes care of him
oh
well we've talked a little bit about the plano school system um i i really have been pleased with plano i have a child who uh my son is learning disabled
yeah
i think we're all contributors i mean every human being that lives is a contributor to pollution so
um-hum
right
um-hum um-hum uh i went to a seminar they said don't ever use your credit card for consumable items you only use credit cards for investments
sure yeah i agree that's right
that's right
well i was trying to think of what kind of things you'd have to change and you'd have to change your height on your driver's license
oh really
oh
yes i'm sure it is you just never know where you are going to be do you [laughter] oh
[noise]
[noise] so they canceled that one and uh are looking next year bringing it back closer but we have a letter a family letter
i used to enjoy going i mean i still do kind of enjoy it but uh it's it doesn't you know it's not as many people there that i really really enjoy seeing
because i think their parents pay more and i think the kids are a little bit more challenged because their parents are probably college educated
for my area yet
and i went to my mother's i read a book that i have should have read when i was probably in high school i read um jane eyre [laughter] no wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute jane eyre no no no no it wasn't jane eyre no it was um
and um [noise]
gosh
see that's we've we had a problem with that
so i got busy got together and put a reunion together for his family and succeeded in getting all of his brothers and sisters and all of their offspring but one
that was that was neat for for me to hear that somebody is
oh yeah
the woods that he'd come in his little log boat down the river and we would have to we'd [vocalized-noise] and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found and
[laughter]
uh-huh uh-huh
where you kind of can spend your whole career on one show of course i guess that's not bad alan alda did it on mash and
oh well well
[laughter]
do your part you know people are not you you you can't be waited on all your life and expect things to always ha- ah work ou- out
uh what kind of quality of life are you leaving them and and the and i have a real concern about that uh
beautiful [laughter] country
well that that's really great um
but
yeah that's true yeah
don't always vote for somebody i sometimes vote against somebody
uh-huh
uh-huh
and uh you know if you're not a home owner it's or if you haven't sold property or uh have something major like that it's hardly you know it it's just not much else you can do
um about the only women you know it a woman at that time could uh clerk in a grocery store or any other kind of store
be a teacher
so for instance uh let's say twenty dollars would go to to the cars you know car repair uh maintenance or whatever another
but uh i was surprised yeah that's a good way to make some money
uh-huh
huh
uh-huh
[noise]
i always like dessert [laughter]
oh that's good
yeah my side of the family is from back in ohio and west virginia and i think we've been to one in thirty five years or something like that so
[noise]
um-hum
you kn- you don't have any any kind of a en- good environment to live in you know it's kind of hard to say well you need to take care of of other people's stuff as well when you're when you
that's not budgeted
not be caught shorthanded
oh dear i hope we we don't don't get in trouble
but uh
that's right and then then they have to work until the shop until the place closes at six p. m. and then it's their responsibility to clean up and be prepared for the next day because they don't have cleaning crews in most of those
for a consulting job that my husband was doing [noise] and
uh-huh do you think you d. base is more flexible or allows you to do more or do you think the others are pretty much compatible these days
i can understand that very easily i've used uh i've had a class on um r. base and also in paradox and both of those seem very easy to use compared to d. base
i would love to be able to go see those
at at the same time or
so so it's good
and it's still tied up in the legal channels they haven't ruled on whether they can test them or not
well i don't know what kind of work you do but there there would be even be a situation where you were at a machine and working with somebody that was that way and
oh yeah i have a niece that is just in love with the littlest mermaid she just thinks that's the best show in the world
well you've seen the more recent one than i have then i have we don't usually go out to movies we usually wait until we can watch them at home
yes
oh isn't that something
yeah it is [noise] i'm a historian and my father had kept them i think since nineteen twenty seven and
okay uh what areas do you usually eat in do you find
let's see we ate at louisiana purchase up in plano just recently we had a craving for catfish and uh they have some good catfish there
[laughter]
right that you
uh no not actually [laughter]
right
two month break
they have a we have a uh
yeah i find that it seems to me and uh maybe this is as you get older i'm in my mid forties now but uh uh i guess from my vantage point i think the quality of t._v. has gone down or else my interests have changed because there were
right [laughter] but the one uh that slipped my mind but the one that i my favorite t._v. show right now i would say is star trek uh the new generation
try to do the justice
well we have uh a situation again that i am familiar with where uh the son of an acquaintance of mine was killed while trying to stop a robbery
uh-huh
[laughter]
but uh i don't know i you you see it in uh also in uh like in the church uh where more and more women are becoming ministers in uh you know in uh protestant congregations and um
and that was great i was able to and i was able to provide for my children and and you know that was wonderful
fix this you know i am having a problem with you know another member of the family she said i have taken a new stance and i say no i will not you know you work it out for yourself
and i
uh-huh
and i used to uh used to have a neighbor in one apartment complex i lived in and she had [noise] at the time her kids were like eleven and nine and five
yep they what one thing i
oh yeah
uh-huh uh-huh
uh-huh
oh a ski boat though
whoa
oh that's true
man it's supposed to be
uh-huh
oh are you do you have friends there or
okay
and i believe that strongly
uh-huh uh-huh
uh keeps you busy
uh-huh
i don't know you know what the realities is going to look like you know we're putting money away already uh but i really think it's important to put these children someplace where in addition to
crime where it's a serial type killer or where maybe a a ch- a child has been deliberately killed or
he stopped them for a routine traffic violation and they
yeah uh uh although it's getting rather expensive since on the last time i had to
what don't you like about the magazines
so we go there anyway so they're they're so if they were to bill which which i believe they don't but if they were to bill the h._m._o. for my business they could in in theory be getting paid twice for the same thing but they're not thank god um
well and and i think uh in the in the in the much bigger picture than uh
it's uh he is a prosecuting attorney
uh-huh
you put a lot of miles on a car or
you know maybe to do that they had couldn't make them where they were just real stable
and uh you know i got all the things i wanted the sunroof and the luggage rack and all that
um-hum
oh yeah oh i guess that's true yeah
yeah they do have them at dillard's and
oh my gosh
i um i'm kind of a pack rat especially when it comes to clothes
[laughter] oh [laughter]
uh we get the uh affect of the
we don't seem to understand how to handle it as a society to say okay it is okay under these circumstances but if you step outside these bounds
and the uh the under
yeah sometimes
uh during the summer season uh they were free concerts but he was with that group for like twenty one years and uh did both very traditional marches a lot of you know john phillips sousa and
but then it's hard to find a place to stack that much music
by a judge or an appeals court and that never makes the the press and so when uh you or i as an individual
and they asked there there there were uh like four people
right right
uh-huh
yeah
yeah
right right
you went to school there yeah right uh-huh
yes yes i'm i'm quite aware
yeah i agree i don't think it should be left up to the judge alone not only you know that they have to stay in there but hey how many times have you heard of judges being bought over
they can't be fired you know they have to they stay till they retire and sometimes they're pretty partial in their judgements too
uh y- you know throw- going ahead and throwing a way a plastic bottle instead of you know separating it and so forth i and i just forget
yeah it vacuums it up and back up into the air several times and chops it up so fine that
she uses the cloth diapers at home but she said when you're traveling it's just almost impossible
yes [laughter]
and um my oldest one just wasn't impressed at all with the idea of a small school
so we kind of uh i guess when i think of social changes i think think more of uh
right right
well out of out of fifteen grandchildren in my family only two of us don't live within fifty miles
he's in a very well fenced backyard that has openings so he can look out and see the kids and chase the kids and he likes that
how about you
so bad that we had to go ahead and um recarpet the entire house [laughter]
uh-huh
and uh she will be attending i think skyline arts magnet uh or arts and
oh yeah
what brought you down here
jimmy you think he can do better this year than he did last year
when he was in high school so uh he creates a real problem for people now
we usually chase them down through there
so anyway but
good grief
lack of of uh family life
i try to be as much as i can
and uh did it describe it to you at all
well of course i'm the little short one that sits on the end by judy dillon
diagram
no it's not i also got a piece of chrome for the the hood that they had indicated was the right part for this car but uh it is not either it's uh obviously doesn't quite fit
really
uh-huh that's true that's true that's true
they're always saying that somebody's going to and some of them i think unconsciously do it you know as a just you know half seni-
um-hum
yeah i do some of that and i i must admit that i do enjoy a certain amount of it i guess it's when it's a requirement such as mowing a lawn that it becomes somewhat less of a hobby
that's right
but i do know through some organized groups like scouts and church um
put in their time so to speak for the
that's really sad isn't it [noise]
right
able to uh work at other kind of menial jobs or are they going to be the thieves and the people in prison and our prisons are filling up faster then we can build them that's no good
so that that was a plus from that respect as well and then with emily it was a neighborhood friend that kept her so
yeah that's true well even the preschools you know they get so much of that in preschool and then when they hit kindergarten
but i don't have any down here
but uh they're getting too thick i need to go thin them out
how nice um-hum
oh
and uh so w- i had always wanted a golden retriever i just think they're real neat dogs that that's a nice breed you know they're real calm and gentle and
yeah so do we
okay i guess we're going to discuss food and cooking
uh-huh
so
perhaps there's less of the middle range then there was
she does shed a lot of fur
um-hum and you have the problem when you travel too we always we board her now and that gets kind of expensive
uh-huh
uh-huh
but uh anyway where do you like to eat
but
you know sort of a bad area but he was just out riding his big wheel and a couple of drug people got into a fight with a gun and he got hit and killed by a stray bullet
oh yeah
uh if you have a chance to rent it at least or it should be out on t._v. i would think
uh-huh
no um but i've heard that's really good too and
how to pick one right
he felt a little easier about that after uh after i told him it wouldn't upset me at all if he found something that he wanted to do rather then copy what i did
coming from plano unless you you really felt you needed something smaller
uh on uh well it was actually it was put on by the power companies and about the various sources of energy and
yeah
i know
and then he died in eighty nine
to everybody
and i guess they said you know sh- do you think it should be restricted i guess if it were if if because a lot of states do still practice capital punishment i guess violent crimes would be the
oh really
um-hum
no no i'm sure it would have to affect you the same way
so
oh
so
it was real nice
[vocalized-noise]
[vocalized-noise] been
uh taking that to the boy scouts and my aluminum cans
in glass bottles and we had a milk shoot at the side of the house
um-hum
[laughter] well i w- tell you ever s- my my kids are just small babies and i tell you we we really want to go a lot and uh there's so much out on video now that it's almost you know the movie comes out quicker than you can go see it
right
uh-huh
[noise]
do you have children
yeah yeah
well it's hard to find the time
right
um sierra let's see yeah sierra's into
[laughter] okay well it's nice talking to you and uh be good thank you
so it seems like one way or the other we're gonna end up paying for it
yeah
[noise]
um-hum
hm i have no idea
oh
[laughter]
they took them back and gave me a credit of about a dollar each time
yeah
they almost look neon you know they're just real colored colorful things on her onto her ends yeah and she d- she's really a good fisherwoman
mixed with one of the small bottles of chili sauce and spread it over the top and spread it on triscuit crackers
and i really you know they they're talking about sports
um speedboats uh you name it they had it and we did a lot of watering [noise] water sports but i think uh the thing i liked the best was uh we spent about a summer
if it's uh
even if we have the i'm sure we'd have the cash before we got it but
a have a nine year old [noise] when when both of my kids were much younger and this time we're gonna be going with just one daughter and she's nine so it ought to just be a ball
a bit and it's something so
we'll probably have to look for a another second car sometime and we'd look for about what you're looking for some- but probably real cheap it wouldn't be a i used used car so but no
oh yes um-hum
made him do that since it was so close together i can see if [noise]
right
huh
uh-huh yeah i mean i could be five too
well you'd have to up it to whatever fifteen percent
[noise] i don't know i- i guess there's never a an answer nobody ever asks
so you have to tape it or something
uh-huh
yeah i think they're the stupidest shows
we used them through a period of time that we needed to and then uh consolidated all of it and brought it into a single controllable
uh they tacked on a a charge each time whereas you know i think i only used it a hundred or two hundred at the time if i had gone ahead and gotten a larger amount each time it wouldn't have been uh quite so expensive
yeah exactly
right where you're getting into the delicate work now do you wh- where did you first get your lessons from
i see [laughter]
absolutely gorgeous an-
uh-huh
yes i do not like the humidi-
well
okay let i'm i'm writing it down
[noise] and it's on it's in addison and it's a great place also a great place that they have like cajun food is copeland's
well i don't feel very good about it but i think that at some times it can be the right thing to do we
oh is that what you usually use in the house is latex
uh two actually um and it there was um you know around the windows if you got it on the glass we let it dry and scraped it after that but that [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation now if you were a skier
[laughter] well normally when we go on vacation we go home to colorado
no you tell me how you feel about
yes
[laughter]
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise] bye bye
uh you bring your bags back you know they uh the plastic bags back or the paper bags you put them in the one of the receptacles there but i didn't realize some people are actually paying you for that hm
don't bring us the manager and all of that unless you wanna bring him right away you're gonna get one shot at us
[laughter]
we have a sears one and we always get a maintenance agreement every year and it's just easier to say you know just put that on my credit card well that's
[noise] hi how you doing doug my name's brad whe- where you from
uh-huh
some have had breakfast and lunch and it's been a whole day affair some [noise] of course just have lunch or
yeah
and uh i guess you can al- and a lot of the restaurants
oh
so i c- both of my parents had big families
that's what we're hoping because we're we're just real close to to where that is so
um well about nursing homes and and older people uh my husband has a grandmother that lives with his mother
uh my see my father is ninety two and still uh he and mother still live at the house and drive and
well and then a- too now like where we had the dry summer and we had to sprinkle constantly my water bill was
oh a long time apart but um
um are working or whatever they're all my parent's age and uh so he's got you know his retirement though is really twenty four hours a day they have a
um-hum
yeah decorating [noise] uh-huh
and uh putting them on blue print on where i'm gonna put them so i'm really into that but uh so i really get into magazines that are kind of basically into um housing type things whether it be
[laughter] so [noise] well i think we've discussed it good enough today [laughter] so it was it was good talking to you maybe we'll get to next time thanks karen bye bye [noise]
so um well what about your wife is she she happy at school or [laughter] she's just ready
communications and computer technology seem
um-hum
yeah well
that's good
a lot different
yeah
do you like highly seasoned uh highly season it
the ones here in the laboratory obviously i'm they're gonna stay but i have similar machines at home i would consider uh uh doing some more consulting when i get home
[noise] um-hum
yeah yeah it's really good and very um you get a good quality for the money you pay [noise]
and anything but domino's
but as soon as you know he went to move in with another girl the show just died
oh my
yeah yeah it's it's it's uh it's probably movable the cabinet but it would be tough to move i was able to take some of the pieces apart it's like a kitchen pantry basically
and a package of lipton onion soup mix
um-hum
are they
and i had two doctors
hm the thing about country western that i don't enjoy is is doesn't seem to be any imagination
yeah
and i was just sitting there going oh my goodness and i'm going to have to stop and explain and they go i know mommy i know
um
um-hum
yeah
uh we my wife and i went and saw a couple of funny ones we saw the naked gun two and a half
and uh i'm trying to think we went to see a uh
uh-huh
uh-huh
uh-huh
yes
so we always had a dog and and then course when my children were growing up we always had a dog and always said it's because
oh i just didn't have time to take care of baby and train puppy at the same time so
and it's you know it was almost from the audience participation it was almost a
yeah and [laughter] i think it's been delayed i think it was originally scheduled for february but the trucks that were supposed to do it there's been some problems with
yeah
yeah yeah but it does sound like it's definitely growing
[noise] uh um kind of a mauve and gray
you know these people have secretaries and these high power jobs and it just seems like um she she told me now her daughter took her first steps at the day care
it's nice that that we could have the choice to stay home
the the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter and uh the one male that she used had a tooth problem
yeah i'm at coit and lega-
right
how much of it is true and how much and how much of it is propaganda
right
yeah
yeah well did you hear on the news where the teacher of the year was up for child molestation
um i really want to see that one it's and it about to come out in on uh
i run out of patience on a movie like that i start checking my watch about an hour and half
in the twin cities is a lot better than what we've heard about california and maybe in
um-hum want to meet my own schedule those are the arguments we hear
uh-huh
i- i remember that from when i was i worked way before i was
my daughter seems to be having a good time she was absent with strep throat the last three days and i ran over and picked up her report card and she did very good so
and it's being being used much more
[noise]
um-hum
yeah
yeah my wife worked at a has worked at a couple of those too and she's never
[noise]
well texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants because our summers are so terribly hot
texas is d- dallas is very nice i really enjoy it there the landscaping the homes the architecture the whole thing it uh [vocalized-noise] very enjoyable gardens and my wife and i
and in for [noise] for mousers you know so they're very nautical too [laughter]
uh-huh
so what are some of your your favorite inexpensive places
[noise] so i don't uh we don't go
oh sure because if you take it into a service station they want to charge you forty dollars just for uh freon which only costs you about three dollars so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price
without
uh you know because i have a feeling it is and i- i think there ought to be more things added to it uh if you
um-hum um-hum
so we can
[laughter]
and uh i'm not going to walk you you know walk anywhere downtown at that time of the day
um-hum
and and really it's they're a lot better than what i get in the restaurant [laughter] that's right [noise] saves you a little bit money
uh well uh
oh wow
then when we actually got out of school and employed and [laughter] we only started getting paid once a month and we found that you really had to budget things or
well see now for myself i'm a c._p._a. so needless to say my budget is probably [noise] extremely well fine tuned uh i've been married now for nineteen years
[laughter] well um [laughter] yeah i i don't know i'm more of a
so i i and i don't think that i don't think that nurses get half the recognition they ought to for example
i wish i had an ear like that because i can sight read
that's when you find out who your friends are i guess
[noise] well i've been real um thinking i'd love to buy a new car right now if i could afford it but we have two cars right now and we're still paying on but i would love to have one of these new minivans
[noise]
they had left her on the bus closed up all afternoon
oh my god
um-hum
you know gee holly would starve to death if we you know we took her to another country so [laughter]
that's right and that's exactly what they said my wife dragged me away from the television
next wars that are coming up that they did for this one in getting rid of a lot of things so
and our male cat you know we had uh neutered right away and course it he doesn't know it and he's still out partying
so i guess it's probably probably if we get another animal it probably wouldn't be a cat even though i love cats i think it would probably be a dog and it would definitely be an outdoor animal
right
and um you know i guess i never was awakened to it you know i knew it was out there but i knew you know i didn't know it was to a an extent
um i just worry about people that have jobs that could hurt other people like bus drivers and
he's the what
oh i s-
that's
and then you know so i eventually got it all paid now i carry one i have a gas card and a visa card and i never use them unless i need to
uh fifteen or twenty i guess
can still make big bucks [laughter]
yeah
[vocalized-noise] used to buy a house for [noise] [laughter]
but um
but uh is it on uh video yet
you know the biggest outlaid expense has always been either wars or defense
and uh things like that and so i cou- and it got so depressing [laughter] seems like it wasn't anything but bad news [laughter]
uh-huh
so you might uh think about that ch-
a white powder
i think i think that they're s- they're so much more vulnerable now because they don't receive support
[noise]
the death penalty is not given often
yeah
say less advantaged areas and uh
they're unreal i mean it's it's almost too much and
swayze yeah
um-hum
one of the custodians was vietnamese
yep
the one two weeks ago and just had a horrendous week and i was just so stressed it wasn't even funny and i just could not possibly make it that that wednesday and then this last wednesday
yeah
yeah yeah well rust and the and the body too huh
well i guess i feel much more comfortable with with judges eith-
yeah well my my dress up i live out in the country also so what i wear depends on the weather
right
th- they are all hunters and you know they they don't appreciate my stand and i i have no i really have no problem with sports hunters
but the last couple we wondered if the kids should watch with and tonight's or tomorrow night's sound pretty bad too so
[laughter] so now he's got to tape tape it again today i think's when it comes back on
so [vocalized-noise] well i've i've gotten in the mood to go now [laughter] yeah [laughter]
would would you [vocalized-noise] mean if you could legislate something what would you legislate
that would be a an an interesting ways yeah
okay
um-hum
um-hum
you can start calling in whenever it's convenient for you but you can only make one call a day
oh i see well this is a pretty good deal
and with our visa that's really high interest we're in the process of transferring from one account to another to get the lower interest on one of the cards
no you're paying interest
have you had any experience with people who have chosen nannies
um-hum
right oh those things are great i boy i encourage those [noise] yeah you're you don't own a house and i'm fifty eight and i just built my fourth home
i've never read anything by him
um-hum
y- yeah i did um northern state in aberdeen south dakota
i think there's only one thing that's worse than the communist government and that's no government [laughter]
right
yeah they coming out of it this year we'll see if it holds on
uh-huh
so you know th- they have lots of tours where they get a bunch of people together and off you go
i think she was a good cat it's just that the other cats were a problem for her
yeah
uh
use it
uh-huh
and uh you're you're leaning more towards investments and things like that to do yours then
um-hum
so isn't that
oh [laughter] good i don't feel bad [laughter]
you know it [noise]
hm um-hum
um-hum
i work for nuskin [laughter] yeah
ha yes in fact i just got some reservations i'm going to go for uh al- almost two weeks this winter
no we don't um we have to pay for our own insurance
to get in
um-hum
it's really [noise] frightening that we're not we're trying to live in our own little cocoons and probably one of the best things we could do for crime is to participate ourselves in its prevention
uh-huh i didn't
[noise] uh-huh
[laughter] i understand that did you did you happen to see it last night
oh yeah
and if i can stay up late enough i like to catch saturday night live every now and then
so
yeah
well that my we've just got a two car garage but my husband's got a big space in between the where the cars are and the house where he has a big work shop you know workbench and everything
well sounds like our husbands have similar interests
oh really
well the the writer director of the series is is going on to a new plot of of horror [noise] i- i- i saw his new movie commercial on the other day i don't remember what it's called
um-hum they really are i just love them
does your club have a good w- woman's association
the and nothing seems to change and uh i'm not sure that anything will because these [vocalized-noise] if something could happen to make these people not wanna buy it
[noise]
i think i paid
oh [noise]
oh yeah i lost twenty five pounds yeah i lost twenty five pounds now you can do the same oh yeah [laughter]
jeez uh i don't know oh i don't know there's got to be thousands
the way to the tournament and what night did we i guess on the way to the sela game last thursday which they're kind of our big rivals and we pr- prayed that she would get to start and that she would play well and she did she played the best i've seen her play
right
it it's so different down here where y- you go and take lessons to learn to ice skate or something you know when our kids were little you you got them a pair of skates [laughter]
oh okay okay
no just regular water
oh how neat uh-huh
oh
yeah i mean if you're in the the three three percent bracket and they take a third of your check every month well that's ridiculous why bother working
[noise] um i think we can have honest government what do you think
yeah
and i'd p- i played a fairly active part in helping them decide where to go on the other hand they really decided themselves um wha- what kind of experience did you have
my son got a full total uh scholarships and so there's uh there's plenty of scholarships out there and so people should be advised to
[noise]
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
um-hum
i bet
they're i- i know they're trying they're really trying the mexican government is trying and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to
i see
that's good do you find that uh the boy is going in a different direction than the girl as far as what his uh um needs are and the type of college he wants
okay
oh
um-hum um-hum
ooh
and keystone i guess those are the only places i've skied up there
so if it doesn't pay a whole lot it's hard to put up with a lot of
uh-huh running around and diaper changing [laughter]
yeah i i i think in the long run i think it's it would be good i think in the short run they think because so many of those tested have gotten away with it you know the the test hasn't come down hard on anyone i don't i don't know
yes if you know someone for example we have uh some friends whose son was driving home from work was hit head on by a drunk driver the drunk and his wife in the car were killed
i i keep a uh one of those uh those banana lounge chairs tha- have the two parts that fold on it
oh no
uh-huh
you know at least for the first couple of years nothing should go wrong with it
sort of the [noise] the world bank and as far as aid is concerned and i think there's a a limit and we've passed it a long time ago
even that priest that was in control there for a while that they overthrew uh i i've read some things about him that he was he wasn't too good himself
i see
you know
oh yeah i would think so like right after um high school you know e- even if it was like the the the their um that summer right after high school you know three months
[noise] well i like them [laughter] i've heard people are allergic to them or something
i think everyone knows it better than most the custom word p-
[noise]
oh i see
oh my gosh
uh if that you know if if they had to get out of it they could and they wouldn't want out of it unless he did something wrong
and that that's
uh-huh
really
so we said the next time around we'd get something little that if something happened it would be easier to carry
right
uh-huh
w- we used to live in utah and uh course there's lots of mountains around there to camp in and and streams and stuff that's that's a great place to go camping and the hiking is just really great
um-hum very much very much
michael bolton type stuff he he's my personal favorite
[noise] well it's ninth nine through twelve
i- i guess so it really is interesting
uh mid nineties to low uh high i mean a low nineties to a mid eighties shooter which that's what i am to being a guy that shoots in the low seventies
oh yeah you know [noise] hold on a second you can't pull up hold on you can't pull up on it it will disconnect
uh so we've been spending
uh especially like good prime rib so if it's uh nice to get out and find a good restaurant like that and i live here in uh rome new york and there are a lot of good restaurants around here
uh-huh
what we're paying
how do you think they would feel i should say about moving from where they have lived most of their life into a whole new new home situation
yeah
uh-huh
that is a pretty car
wow well you get a much bigger better comfortable ride
[noise]
uh
you know i wanna i wanna throw some charcoal on the grill and and throw a steak on there and some baked potatoes and stuff like that but um
oh upstate oh okay oh okay is that where you you're originally from around there
i'd have to go look around my room for the books i've read and they're still stacked there
uh
yes
[laughter] or when people like look through my things in my bedroom [laughter]
i uh
scope
um-hum
um
it's just one story yeah it's a fox and jacobs home
five bedrooms
um i haven't given this a a lot of thought i'm
and he had taken some kind of um oh you know uh just he had some kind of flu or something he got a real bad migraine and he took his mother's
[noise]
that's very important
i- in my situation we had to consider nursing care and uh
um i've gone to this nursing home over on um forest lane and greenville out there
right
well i don't uh much well actually hardly at all i um the only times that i've actually golfed is we we were uh going to a family reunion up in maine every year
and that's very challenging at chase oaks uh lot of water
right
but we uh this is a big golf area
yeah
but uh i haven't i haven't gotten into fuel injectors and things like that and that thing's fuel injected so i don't know what uh um
and they probably do the same things
[laughter] i mean the communists got it anyway
and he came up upon a a vietnamese and they both had their guns on each other and they just looked at each other and put their guns down and walked away
uh even uh i think new zealand is
uh-huh
yeah you we we were talking about that just the other day what did we do without it back then i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps [laughter]
oh it was but the end result is after you put your your panels on nobody sees that you got one screw missing in your your window regulator anyway and it it runs it works just the same so
and you know
[noise] well i think that's a big part of it and i- i think it maybe started because women wanted outside of the home and i almost think with our society and and inflation and the cost of things it's anymore it's almost couples have to work outside the home [noise]
[vocalized-noise] okay i have come upon a recipe several years ago that is th- now i don't care for fruitcake period
[noise]
[noise] yeah at the moment i've got a cadillac cimarron which is approaching its tenth year of age and a uh
what the uh the first one is we need people in there that that understand uh numbers and the numbers that are being thrown around when when we're talking in trillions of dollars
oh how nice
uh-huh
saint louis is trying to get a team uh baltimore is trying to get a team and there's some other city i'm wanting to say raleigh durham but i'm not sure
you know i think you're right i think it is raleigh
certainly that might have something to do with it but i also think that
angel at my table
[noise] uh-huh um another one that i really liked was called truly madly deeply
yeah bye
good
so you you all actually had some color huh [vocalized-noise] it kind of crept in and
uh-huh
yeah
[noise] uh peter jennings yeah a lot better than any of the other uh announcers
yeah because you can al- you just wash those you know so
oh yep
yeah
hm well good luck to you in pursuing your nursing degree
does that well see that's another plus
it's dropping but i think it's about a dollar fifteen on an average
yeah
uh-huh
i know i wish it would come on earlier but obviously the sitcoms make more money or they you know or they wouldn't have it on at eleven [laughter] but uh
well that's the time that they charge you for you know the time and the and the they even charged me now i went and gave my own blood
[noise] well what uh jeez i wonder what they would've charged you if you had somebody else's blood
oh yeah
right
ryan against ryan yeah his son pitched for u._t.
did you yet push the button oh okay okay no no that's that's it
and then he plants about a quarter of an acre of sweet corn for me to use so i get out of that amount of work at any rate
uh renewed you had to meet the pollution standards
that might help a little bit especially in some places we're really lucky here we have a prevailing southerly wind that blows just about everything out
i yeah i think that's a a good thing i-
you know and it it ju- just doesn't happen that you get out in four years
[vocalized-noise]
yeah yeah
uh-huh
huh
uh waiting to a light was green making a left hand turn in the correct lane what's to make you know and they had they went all through my car
and uh well i grew up in south dakota so everybody has a truck
you have any uh favorite foods [noise]
[noise] um one of the things that i have had a lot of fun doing is collecting recipes uh well not really a i don't have lots but i have
where we came from in north carolina i mean it was a nice area but we didn't have any the mea- the
i felt good in the sense that i was really putting my money the way i felt it was back into uh the taxes uh and it went actually most of it went to the schools and uh to school reforms things like this so uh yeah i i saw it really as a positive thing
and we put that out by the street and they collect those on monday and then on wednesday
then then that you know
oh well see i agree with you uh it seems like the the crime rate has gone up even more um here this year they're talking about uh there're more murders in dallas um almost uh since last year and
about um twenty five twenty six years ago my brother-in-law showed up in my front yard pulling a trailer and in this trailer he had a pony
[noise] yeah how big was he
and it's a real real they're they're real trade-offs there
um right
[laughter]
i know
oh oh me too me too so i know uh i- i know that i uh you know i just work and i'm just tired when i get home and i i just don't feel like cooking
but it is a difficult situation i think and they're when they're little it's almost easier to leave them because when they're three and they're cry
uh but it's it's it's a glorious movie [laughter] um and i like as you know these these these [vocalized-noise] si- silly movies
oh really
oh yeah but yeah and i used to watch that when i worked day when i worked nights
i don't really watch that too often
the neatest thing i finally got to go to one i wanted to go to for twenty some years for my birthday my husband made the mistake of asking me where i wanted to go and i told him [laughter]
uh-huh
and everything and uh
[noise]
all right i i like keep forgetting to make these calls i've been on this list for two months and i think i've made four calls
[noise]
i'm used to it now so i like
luckily everything was under warranty so it's only costing like a hundred and forty dollars to get it fixed it would have been like two thousand
yes
right
and i think too [noise] noticing the kids [noise] that the fourth and fifth graders a which is what my son is and stuff they they're just they're more they're very open
that's true and maybe that's what it is maybe they're just coming you know they're constantly working on them
you enjoy that
what what what brought about the fading of the paint
public uh
stuff and if we got the other kind that covered all this it would be six or seven hundred a month for the two of us see that's why we do it the way we do
and she says she's getting very frustrated and very depressed because the school is pressuring her to pass them on even though they're not ready but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money
i like the peaches and the
[noise] and um let's see what was the question did we supposed to c- [noise]
joe pros
oh i see well i like the atmosphere myself
um-hum
[noise]
boy that sounds like it sounds like it was a
um-hum
and i usually work teach at night and my wife was here in the daytime and i mean at night and then i was here most of the day if they were when they were here so
how long have you been with uh t._i.
[noise]
it was just for a kick i know
and god they were all so young well you know the girl that plays d._j. cameron that's um kirk cameron's sister do you ever watch growing pains
oh oh where people just [vocalized-noise] just call you
um-hum
oh
it's been real fascinating and
oh boy that'd be an eye opener wouldn't it i mean right next to us is such a pitiful country
exactly [laughter]
i don't know about after accidents because industrial accidents i guess are relatively rare at t._i.
[noise]
oh in new hampshire all right
that one little spot in new hampshire we have ten miles of coastline i live on one of tho- that little ten mile spot
oh
uh-huh
uh-huh uh-huh [laughter]
yeah [laughter]
yeah
hm
if i was looking at a u._s. map i would say it was sort of reminds me of of a uh
oh really
and it's safe
oh really
even the [noise] even their mother's day out programs i heard are really good
hm
there's just something about that cadillac that whether it's a g._m._c. product or whatever seems they handle better and
i've uh i had an eldorado was my first one was an eighty and uh
and i do not envy these mothers or these fathers that have these the children that they have to rush home from work and pick them up at day care get them through their homework get them to their soccer practice get them to their piano lessons i mean that's tough
and uh boy i'll tell you these are the the go-gettingest happiest people i've ever met you know [laughter] because [noise]
yeah
barbara um oh what was her name
you bet because my mother and dad both were there so it really paid off
uh-huh did you g- take your kids with you or was it the adults
yeah
uh-huh
i know and it was serious [laughter] mine too i wasn't this was it my last chance [laughter]
i know [laughter] and you know and i'll tell you when you you know and i've been accustomed all my life to throwing everything in one bag and then uh dumping it in the dumpster it's going to be a rude awakening to have to uh start sorting everything
right right i discovered with uh charge cards um
sure
but
yeah i wouldn't like to go to the same place all the time
[noise]
but i- i don't know [laughter] first of all they don't they haven't done too well against the eagles lately
dinner
uh-huh
okay
and she just she thoroughly enjoys the kids she really likes them
ooh you're brave [laughter]
uh-huh
uh i like some clint black s- you know some garth uh
i said arlington texas because the other day i was talking to somebody and he was in arlington virginia [laughter] ye- yeah that's the only one i've gotten out of this area
[noise] oh no
just t-
[laughter]
sounds like a lot of fun yeah it's amazing to me how how many things they would allow
well think of how many illegal aliens have have have been uh you know sent back to mexico just to find their way back
yeah
okay you don't have any children
several hills close by that we that are kind of designated sleigh riding hills and and we take the tu- you know the tubes and toboggans and
uh-huh
uh-huh
[noise]
yeah
i have a boyfriend and he has this duplex and he's he rented it out to these people that had a i don't know had one or two dogs and they just they ruined the whole thing
[laughter]
book after another and and i was telling her about the library here in houston that has uh one particular library that has all of the mysteries arranged in one area uh
i uh i well i end up just picking out key sections and reading those and the rest of it if i get to it fine if not
hundred car is going sixty two yeah so it would be more like uh like ninety i guess car is going fifty five uh you suddenly have a [laughter] have a even worse problem with speeding than we do now
right we had uh city councilman here that won by like a handful of votes you know ten votes or something
oh
understand understand that
right
[noise]
yeah
yeah i've i've had all kinds of different foods i travel a lot but [laughter] never cooked it myself so
is it that you don't have the time to work on it like you'd like to or you're just tired of it after doing it for so many years
gosh what kind is it
[noise]
huh well that's terrible
no no [laughter] i just
yeah yeah you know that's pretty relaxing to me like this
in public safety situations you know airline pilots and flight controllers and people who run trains and buses and taxi cabs
uh that you can go to that the company picks up the tab for and also it's really an excellent program i kn- it seems like the older ones here are in favor of it the younger ones you know course are still
m- uh my brother
yeah
and then i felt real bad and i said well i'll take it because i ordered it you know and i it was my fault because i didn't specify what i wanted on it or anything i just kind of left it up to them
stay in a dormitory if you can go to classes talk to faculty members and students
earn money towards college and also if they stay within their state you get a lot more financial aid or uh it's a lot cheaper if you stay within your state than if you go out of state to a private school um
you you know you're told if you find them guilty then this is the choices that they have to make it's either life or death you know
um-hum
[laughter] who could be worth that huh [laughter]
uh-huh
it was crowded no
well i've gone to you know one for real live trek convention but
oh well i've had season tickets since um nineteen sixty seven so i've seen a few games
yeah you know he couldn't really top it so uh and now i'm sure he's making more money doing uh you know sports reporting
or you can decide if there is mitigating fact or something to that effect but it's not like you go and say you know we we recommend this punishment you just say we answered these questions this way
[noise] i don't know wow
um-hum
i don't know it's some kind of a little drain shaft or something and and it makes a pool and then it goes on down the little creek that they dammed up to make the lake in the first place and they were there's a little pond kind of a
yeah that that durham raleigh and chapel hill is the triangle
huh
so uh you know i've touched on that and uh
yeah
yeah my husband got his doctorate at b._y._u. so that's and so he just graduated this past year
well i think you're absolutely correct
because i know somebody who's very bright and very intelligent but just doesn't get the grades and that's just because they have a learning disability um so yeah i think you have a good point there where they don't focus enough on them
i have been yeah we went uh the first time i went over there i went to germany and went to munich and stayed right across the street from one of the original medieval beer halls
well sure but you know when you think about reasonableness now i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in th- the tort theory you know what tort theory is
and so
oh pretty
yes w- it was hard to find um apartments out here we live in uh penn state university and it's hard to find apartments that take pets so we're way on the outskirts of town
oh yes and that's one of the reasons i like the university too because you do get credit for your own work um [noise]
okay
right and and to me i mean you take away a person's freedom you've taken away most of their life
right
all right
for the the person who's turn it is that month and we have the uh
i'm not really a drinker so i'm not
is uh to take some let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think is that what comes in those little blocks
are you comfortable that bobby witt will be back
it was inconsistent
yeah right probably going to throw them in your trash [laughter]
registering our garbage [laughter]
[laughter] i know
[noise]
well i think so uh it was on what thanksgiving i was in florida and i watched it again have you seen the butcher's wife
oh no
[noise]
[laughter]
right now i have a eighty seven cavalier
right [laughter]
swimming on easter day and it was like really cold up here but came back with a little tan so that was nice [laughter]
right
and they also have centers where you can take aluminum cans and um plastic bottles
uh no you probably get charged like a nickel or something like that
automobiles there's just no real mass transit here and i think it's a a major drawback for houston a a close runner up to that would be all of the uh
uh-huh yeah
okay
they don't let you take guns to work do they
other than gossiping about people so that's where i learned it and then i s-
[laughter]
well i think part of the problem is the election goes on way too long in britain you know they have a set period of time and and for campaign that's it in this country it seems like it's a continuous ongoing campaign
the most qualified and can get the [vocalized-noise] uh the job done
you know the bulk of the paper certainly is about business kinds of activities
um-hum
but i'll bet it was interesting out there on the boat in the water and everything
there's nowhere in texas i haven't been i don't think
yeah i think that's probably good a little more integration
yeah
um-hum
for the holidays
i come from a family of golfers i mean i was raised by a man my stepfather who with a two handicap i mean he cou- he he could get down on his knees and hit the ball
um-hum
i know where you mean there's a mobil and all that kind of s- uh on that one corner that's about lookout there i think isn't it
hm
oh okay
so
how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting well i th- excuse me go ahead
yes
[vocalized-noise] that's great i remember that movie and i remember that it was very good i don't remember if i saw it or not [laughter]
just feel good
but i i like that i love danielle steele and and [vocalized-noise] you know if i wanna get a fantasy and
[noise]
oh you bet
[noise]
and how they improve and and learn much more so than my own kids when when your own children are growing up you just take them for granted and you go ahead and do your thing and holler at
that's right
i thought people kind of get so overloaded and most people are trying to lose weight anyway [noise]
love them
i don't think that they anyone has a lot of respect or faith in the government
it is
and
favorite players
boy i'll say yeah how old how old do they let them play
bye-bye
but i need to do something if only walk the dog or something i need to start doing that
uh-huh
weather is beautiful down here real nice real nice it got up to about seventy five degrees down here and that's kind of the right temperature to be painting things but
yeah
[noise]
i'm kind of disappointed that that uh the two parties have such a stronghold in the in the nation because i- if if you belong to any other party uh you know any other platform i should say uh y- you're not represented
um what do you think about the different you know the different formats the republican and democrat
uh if they're habitual like three times caught for rape or child molesting then snuff them
yeah
oh god yeah they'd have it a lot of time for christmas
oh see and i just don't i don't dare try all that stuff because i don't even know if i like it to begin with [laughter] if i don't like it it doesn't get made around here
oh
[noise]
um-hum
that are the problem it's it's the people
[laughter]
well funny you should mention that
so everything that lives around here is real tough
my goodness
uh-huh
bumper
i don't know i just read about that the other day and i had never even thought of it actually it makes sense to a certain extent because sometimes
i gue-
well i play piano and organ and have since i was a child and i sing in church choir and have done that since i was a child and still sing now
oh
and uh
and go jogging for uh
pardon
well good luck to you there in idaho
[noise] i'm not sure what it ever [vocalized-noise] what it really accomplished having them uh locked up for that long did the uh did their captors ever really say this is why we're holding them and
right
um-hum
yeah i thi- [noise]
i think it's very strange that [noise] the media hasn't um questioned him [noise] more strongly to
i made it as far as hearst castle but i didn't go any farther
oh
well you know uh the have you seen any of the statistical reports on the the
not yet not yet we're we're working towards that we're not but it's not quite that bad yet i hope that
yep i agree i think i think a lot of times the mutts the best dogs anyway just because they're you know
[laughter] but it was a real small dog and he's thinking of getting another one i don't know if he will or not but he wants to get another dog my mom
ah and the school gets paid off immediately ah they don't provide very much education and uh
well see in my days when i was a teenager my i wanted to go to school my mother said well she didn't want to send me to school i was going to get married anyway she said
like in publishing yeah
a healthy team for one year and a good break also this thing with roy tarpley it just upset everyone i think fans owners management everyone
and uh [noise] dallas got hotter i mean temperature wise but i [vocalized-noise] you know houston can get just as uncomfortable
and uh and and and very cold in the winter uh but
all worked out all right huh [laughter]
that was an all day job just to get it plumbed
uh care i- i assumed that they have certain requirements for their uh nursing and medical staff uh some sort of requi- state requirements or
yeah
um
so i just charged a little on each and uh and you just get the um
right
and it'll drop their earnings by a hundred million a year forever more
um
[noise] oh yes
yeah i remember going to work one day and just crunching on the stairs it was terrible
no my kids were the one to the one in uh out in california
go to private schools private schools here are very expensive
uh-huh
[noise]
we used to have those uh you know the posted warning days uh however in colorado now
but um there are still a lot of people who'll insist on on driving their own automobiles uh to go everywhere
[laughter]
[noise]
it just cuts right through you like you're not even there
right right
[noise]
so you know i bet they have a lot less problems with drug with drugs over there than we do here
exactly yeah there's
yeah i agree
people and all that and you probably would not get a very favorable answer out of them
yeah and we don't know who's ha- handling them now so that's a whole different story now
you know
and so i've i've [noise] had them all and and uh
um-hum
[vocalized-noise] you know in their adult years and in college uh you know that they just
yeah you got to join the club that's seventy five bucks for two years first [laughter] then you go through the drawing and uh yeah it it it's you got to
you're kidding oh that'd be wonderful we got to get there first and [laughter]
and uh see the the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home
exactly what happened to them
i- i kind of wish i had them the size property and
it's kind of how i did it too
yeah you felt some muscles that you [laughter] oh i haven't been skiing for years
that's right so but you know it works i guess
yes i bet it is [noise] do you have problems with them uh your fish eating each other
um you know that was mainly for people in motor homes or
plus you um kind of makes you appreciate some lot of the things you take for granted
i've never talked to anyone who's not from dallas yet have
well good for you that must mean
well i have a whole slew of the them but i really i use i have a visa um but my visa is an automatic draw from my credit from my
well yeah it it was probably [vocalized-noise] more local interest obviously but
right
they would try to get him to exercise they would try to uh you know they would check him over temperature
[vocalized-noise]
nobody even unless you were paying attention at the very beginning you don't even know their names and they uh uh from what i've been reading in the paper they are the ones who are gonna
uh-huh
oh
but i tell you i- i sure uh recommend it for any any any young boy girl too i mean i- i really enjoyed my time in the scouts
and uh
yes i have
oh yes well we moved actually down here from another location and it's spectacular the the thunderstorms and rain storms you get in the spring time the torrents of rain
so
so
yeah it is
beautiful clear water down there i'm sure
a normal freeze is around november twentieth and we had our freeze this year on november second and between the second and the tenth of november in those eight days we set record lows six of eight days
if i have it do over again i will go with a major corporation because w- gust because the guy retires and [vocalized-noise] there goes your warranty when he retires
uh-huh
or when i got on it
but um what what ones have you seen lately
yeah well we never used to do that until this other theater went in and it's you know it's inexpensive and it's entertainment for night
boy
[noise]
he could have lost his life if it wasn't for someone who cared enough to say let's give you a drug test and find out where you're at
um-hum it's just a random thing that they'll get a call in the m-
when the majors that were open to women were well we could major in business but that meant that it we would either teach school be secretaries or bookkeepers not accountants just bookkeepers
and mostly just movies when there's a good movie on actually when there isn't a good movie on too i just like to have the t._v. on if you know if i'm home alone or something
five dollars a call [noise] gosh i wish i could do that [laughter] we can't get paid for it
oh goodness
okay
oh well i suspect that mister yeltsin probably knows a lot more about it than he's ever let on
or craft
any stuffed animals or
kids that are just funny i mean i just look at them they just make me laugh [laughter] they have you know hair that sticks straight out and stuff like that
oh is it [noise] i don't think it's [vocalized-noise] quite as bad in utah as it is throughout the nation
uh-huh
yeah is she still mobile though
well i'm afraid the nearest mountains to us are several uh hours away
uh-huh how did you like that was that too fast oh was it oh uh-huh
[noise]
sure
pretty much that time
that's right
right it's about uh bugsy siegel who um pretty much started flamingo out in vegas he had like the vision of you know vegas what it could be what it is today
but it it works pretty good it measures you know it measures your your pulse and and and your miles per hour and calories expended and you know it has levels of difficulty from one through nine and so forth but i don't even remember the name of it any more
yeah i think that's a problem too so
um-hum but just it's a lot of responsibility
you know drugs and that and that's probably the biggest problem we have right here in the community is is these kids coming up up a canyon here and going up south for that kind of a thing and that brings a lot of
[vocalized-noise]
or that woman who died just rec- the one who died just recently got it uh from her dentist

oh okay yeah
uh-huh
um a- and people always bring refreshments for after rehearsal and hang around for an hour or so and that's probably why we get so many people

uh-huh
[noise]

yeah
well that's one thing they've got they've got every type of imaginable camping on the beach and all of these come with
we do- we find we don't need them and uh it seems like it's just a an added tack on plus a lot of their credit cards now you know will guarantee
i don't
almost operatic in style [noise] it's really wonderful it it's very different but very wonderful ooh good stuff
the pla- at work would you like them to be able to search your purse and and then every time
yeah [noise]
uh-huh

um
yes definitely
uh we get time uh and then i get uh uh well i guess i don't get any electronics magazines anymore i get uh electronics uh
and uh makes me a little nervous that uh students don't seem to show that respect and
and when it was skirts it was like get down on the floor and we hold the ruler up here and it's no more than so many inches above the knee [laughter] because it was mini skirt time back there at one time
[vocalized-noise] uh get some of the benefits of the either the profit high times or or in a sense suffer during the low times
um personal opinion there's a whole lot of weapons available on the market that really shouldn't be available at all
yeah
oh [laughter] uh my family goes up to uh cub river up to willow flat
oh that's n- nice yeah
yeah that's that's certainly my was my experience just uh
[laughter]
just a straight table saw or to get one of these uh rotary arm saws radial arm saws i guess what they're called
uh players
the problem we have now is our car it doesn't have a bench seat up front so if we had the bench seat then we would be fine but when we bought it we
um-hum
but i- i'm i
uh-huh
um
[noise]
i think it has a lot to do with it [laughter]
uh-huh
of ram and then uh it it it likes to live on about a hundred and fifty megabyte hard drive
a state funded program for citizens of those two states
i'm i'm i'm just i'm north of addison actually
uh-huh uh-huh
part of the hiring procedure is a a blood test [noise] um
okay we got a couple more minutes then i guess [noise] uh think what else i can say about that um
green beans
i think it's it's more frequent now it's probably like forty fifty percent
people working in the in in america to um uh to put any trust into our political officials if they don't you know [vocalized-noise] uh
um-hum
so
[noise] right
uh-huh oh that's right and the neighbor they thought it was the neighbor
[laughter]
what am i i don't know
uh-huh
so
and then i don't answer it if i don't wanna talk to you
they're so swamped they let you get by yeah
oh
oh tha-
oh
uh-huh
so i mean i kind of biting the hand that feeds you if you really wanna
that's kind of the way ours is too
[laughter]
got all the materials on it but we're saving foil and accumulating balls of foil in our room
uh-huh
um
so [noise]
oh yes that's wonderful that's one of my favorite books that's really neat yeah i like books like that too
is that right
uh we uh we pretty much live on about eight nine hundred a month
which is a huge subroutine libra-
that's that takes a good bit to make one that's predictable but still worth watching
no i don't think so uh we have three children and we were able to put all three of them through college and um
that's wonderful um i'm sort of beginning in that score um we have a two year old daughter and hope to have another child soon so
yes like a we have uh six children and i gave each of them some for their trees this year
on the ones that you um do for your like if you get the quilt do you get to pick what pattern you want or
um-hum
um-hum
and as it turned out they were in a civil war one with another and really we i i question us you know now of course uh hindsight is all too clear um
oh okay i- i play that about six times a year and every year i hang my bag up uh i- if i get that fi- or six and i swear
well
yeah
how long would it be in the m- how long would it be in the microwave
have i um no i guess not
so that has a children's menu or uh-huh
well
uh to quote my father a woman's place is in the stove
yep
yeah the starters are kind of fragile
yeah
oh if he leaves then they're they're done with they won't go anywhere this year i mean that's their two biggest guys that are walking so
they signed a couple of their pitchers who are gonna be free agents
okay in the north end of the state you got that little narrow strip of west virginia going up between ohio and pennsylvania [noise]
oh great congratulations
like if i go on trips and stuff i take it with me in case my car breaks down or something but other than that i keep it locked up [laughter]
right
uh-huh
alfredo i might have had the parmigiana
are you
um-hum
yeah [noise] yeah i think i think that that's probably right because in terms of long term you you just got to get people
so my mom comes over in the morning and gets her ready for his school or just hangs by while she gets ready drives her to school then i'm home to pick her up so i'm very very lucky [laughter]
um you know they have the smoke stacks i guess you call them i don't know what you call them and different things like that
yeah that's that's what i see burning a lot and i'm not exactly sure what they're burning i know uh-huh there's some oil companies and and i'm sure that that contributes a lot just the burning of the che-
uh-huh
in such a way that nobody would want to do that and and it our constitution expressly forbids that kind of punishment
when the time came only about half that amount of people came so it wasn't you know you have to really just get an accurate amount and but overall we all had a good time we saw people we hadn't see in a while so
uh
no no i have just retired from um the southwest medical center
[noise]
so th- they end up having an all male jury
oh
uh-huh
so it was quite a bit of work
right
even though i don't have to dress during the day you know in anything that dressy i still feel better i feel more professional when i'm dressed up
i- i feel like as families you know we need to take care of the older ones in our families
and uh sometimes we as you said don't know a lot about where we are putting somebody that we care about and it's hard to know what the best uh place is um-hum
midway like around i think it's a little past or it's right before midway or it's right at midway
that's a good seafood place yeah
oh yeah
are uh you know unusual in our society
[noise]
but i've always always enjoyed what chances i had to do wood working
yeah
yeah it's about oh about six months old
yeah
mayer outside prescott
but uh then you can uh take a uh take a little bus across the island to the to the gulf side rather than the bay side and uh
and um then it doesn't bother me very much
because i've heard that you know you get locked into routines and you're gonna hit this up point where you just stop developing
um well
uh-huh
okay
um-hum
yeah
um-hum
right
at every turn the tacticians were denied access to information which is a biggie and uh components you know whatever it took to do the job by the politicians
yeah okay yeah and he wanted uh uh some uh chili dip that i usually make too so
[laughter]
um-hum
uh layering but you use thin it out a little bit uh or make it a little fluffier and you put uh line the whole pie crust with that
uh-huh
but we've got an eight percent state sales tax
yep any way and see um we use to go to some of the the games there but we really haven't done much with the mavericks here
well i think they need to
you know it's uh
yeah so what do you feel are the current trends in the way families spend time in general you know in america
o- okay she is transcribing these tapes for t._i.
oh no
yeah
uh-huh
i know i know no uh the the keeping the faith is great because uh you see you know all these people in the courtroom and they have these girls dancing [laughter] on the railings on the sides
um-hum um-hum
so and i'd never had that problem before but i guess age is starting to catch up to me [laughter] it's showing up in the weirdest places
[vocalized-noise]
oh shoot
okay have you ever
[laughter] right that's right well i um
yeah
[laughter] well you'll get to different levels i guarantee you that [laughter]
they they like to [noise] both boy things [laughter] yeah
well no i guess we can end yeah it's just whenever we're
i mean what basis you know of comparison do we have really [laughter] we don't get a you know
whether the thing is going to fit or not
oh does she what
yeah i like the idea of having it on site something like that i think that's
hey it was a pleasure talking to you too take care bye bye
yeah they they real good they
is that right
i still don't believe capital punishment should be used unless they're repeat offenders
um-hum
yeah
and the next thing that we're getting ready for is a big faculty luncheon and we're gonna give them italian food [laughter]
you know and the jacket i like that but
yeah
and
and
i didn't know there were different types of plastic though
yeah
[laughter] that's awful [noise]
yeah
so if you look at russia and what's happened over there i think the change in communism was as a result of the economic problems that they were experiencing
[noise]
sphere s. p. h. e. r. e.
i- i don't know i just didn't think it was as suspenseful as as
they're they're fond of like i say they like to keep them for a couple of hours but boy when they send them home with us they sure you know it cause they have been spoiled to death
um-hum
yeah
yeah
um-hum
[laughter] it's very wealthy town and we're not part of that but i [laughter] it is you know and i think what i see a lot of parents a lot of mothers working just for bigger and better
he's got to have to uh
yeah
[noise]
so we'll play either out there or at firewheel that's usually where we play but i've played you know different courses in in the dallas area
um-hum me too i mostly like classical and jazz
[noise]
[noise] uh i think so he teaches a lot in plano at high schools but i think he teaches at brookhaven
um
uh-huh
i'm tired of the big city that's for sure yeah
um-hum
so my buddy and i we just camped [laughter] and we figured what the hell we did it when we were kids and we loved it
yeah
so of course i couldn't pay that on a cre-
yeah
yeah right and uh [noise] the idea of running a a school
uh uh i just find it
they had some professor on there who was uh building a it was like a it was kind of like a space station but it was supposed to be for people you know and uh experimental stages
[noise]
so you'll have to do that once i wanna go on another one but i wanna go to alaska
um-hum
[noise] is it's pretty it it's it when it's genetically engineered
huh
uh-huh
[noise] that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood he went to [noise] oh furrows i guess to buy his paint and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
um-hum
um-hum
but they've never really been successful in it and the supreme court has has up to this point continued to reject those types of arguments
i got a six year old that's [noise] going out of [noise] off of his mind [noise] he acts like he just ate a pound of sugar [noise]
[noise] yeah but it this this is a true one it was this seemed a little different so i was reading that one last night [noise]
[noise]
i'm sure it'll sound horrible to you but is i program for fun on my computer
um-hum um-hum
yeah
[laughter]
no no i really don't
oh tom grieve
[laughter]
it's lee
[noise]
well
um-hum
oh congratulations
uh-huh
so i i guess those are the types i like [laughter] we've really enjoyed them we've gone to um germany switzerland austria
and then of course when that movie out of africa came out [laughter] um but i've always thought it would be neat to go on a safari over there
and they were really good i really miss them
and you like it
you know what was why she had to go there
almost no no uh
uh well a lot of it is drug related but i- i think that there is just an excessive homicide rate and an excessive amount of arms bearing uh you know personal arms bearing
it you know they say i guess a lot of the people that they the the gang related things they put them in jail and then they they when they get out they just say get lost just don't hang around l. a. or don't hang around wherever and so they just move on to new territory and where ever they can find easy pickings but
so uh
how about yourself
[laughter]
but
uh-huh i know it hm
in every room in my house
uh my wife really likes to paint different colors and things so
uh course iowa city i don't know how hard how hard is it uh in the public school system in iowa city is it is it uh deteriorated a lot do the people say or are they pretty happy with it or
yeah
yeah the episode that i watched um
uh well it was an outside pipe so n- this time i made sure i wrapped them up real good um-hum
it always happens huh
it's such a great game i- i- i play thr- you know thirty six holes after work
there's a place here in dallas it's called dave and buster's
i don't kn-
yeah
uh-huh
until i guess they decided to join the club and come up with their own credit card another credit card that was accepted so
um-hum i mean you know federal tax i mean everybody has to pay standard around the u._s. and that doesn't bother me that much you know the you buy a house you cut your taxes a little bit the rest of it you pay what you owe
oh well it will
oh so you've yeah
oh
yeah
[noise] you know we had this in the vietnam war you know we had [noise] you know population of blacks among military people in vietnam was about eighty percent
yeah that's probably true there's a lot more uh
our daughter's two so i'm in sort of in the same boat that you are [laughter]
well i'm i thought it said other than salary but yeah
right
[noise] that's really true that's kind of the way that i have felt it i also feel guilty um not
and and to take time out and uh study the issues in depth would take quite a bit of time and i don't have the time to devote to that
um-hum
well i had an h._m._o. up to this year i switched
yeah gets you know you you watch the super bowl for the commercials and that's about it all the new ones that come out so
right
roast chicken
[noise]
oh
yeah the thing i like about cats is they're more independent you can leave them and they can take better care of themselves than a dog it seems like you know depends
oh
[noise] yeah that's that's not too bad at least you're inside you don't have to worry about the bears and [laughter]
hopefully she'll learn to enjoy it as much as we do
really
and it's also unlike california completely because it's cool enough that you don't have uh the surfers much because they need protective clothing you know
yeah i mean considering the conscious it seems to go [noise] i- i- it almost invariably does start with the destruction of the family [noise] i mean
i think that'll be real interesting to see what they can do they're ahead and the lakers are down i guess in fourth uh position in the west and i don't know in the east i don't know uh is it boston in uh first place
uh
i- hopefully if we ever get our road system fixed up this will get a lot better
[noise] well [noise] yeah
it's it really is it really is they gave us a hard topic [laughter]
then i'll have three p. c.'s
yeah is that what yours is
um-hum
do air travel and all but uh i make sure that one's always uh paid off because i'm responsible for the interest on that one if [laughter] if i don't pay it off uh uh
and then heard yells and screams and the next thing i know there are policemen all around my house
[noise]
[noise] i've just never [noise] i've never moved up to a really big class of sailboat um once i get my son into and through with college he's gonna be starting uh rice next year so he's going off but
uh-huh
yeah right right
i know i don't think i've ever met anyone that didn't
[laughter] well you may be right [vocalized-noise] what i think is really gonna be interesting is to see how uh we as a society deal with it and i and i think it is what you say it's it's a
actually no he sleeps real well at night
no that's where my wife's from and we also visited seattle where i'm from
well uh
hi
oh heaven
interesting quit on general principle
third party and there's supposed to be a lot of safe guards and all that
right well they've entered the work force more uh you know since world war two is when they started
uh with his right hand we went wow we better have him do s- do something you know educationally
knowing from what my daughter has gone through she's she learned a lot and it course it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it it was something easily forgotten so
yeah
the human operating system is my are-
[laughter]
[laughter] you'd think so
and now we can relax a little bit more because basically we don't really require as much on a daily or a monthly basis as we did before so we're we don't have to have quite as strict uh a budget as we did
[vocalized-noise]
and the cowboys don't have a [noise]
[noise] and i needed air-conditioning and um
huh
oh really
i th- i think they'll work it out eventually yeah like you say it will be a major breakthrough right now they're sort of
it often depends how far you want to go back o- on our particular family reunion they went back to my great-great-grandfather
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
it's gonna bring very good things and uh we're going to be a lot better off as a society as it continues but it's a painful transition
um when i graduated from high school um my uh band my jazz band and we visited europe i visited germany and austria um italy
it was uh it was interesting
yeah i i know what you mean about the interest rates it's uh it's unbelievable
i just won't do it i mean she's paying i don't know i don't know what per month you know forty fifty dollars per month in interest and i just you know i just refuse to give it to them if i need to borrow that kind of money i'll go to the bank and uh
yeah same here certain parts of our city uh you just don't go by you just don't [laughter]
you know it's just too many problems with uh people getting paroled bef- uh you know early and coming out committing another crime while they're still on probation we've had a lot of problems out here with that course
uh-huh
i don't think i have the energy or the money [laughter] for those sort of beautiful old homes now
uh-huh
well they
oh i see oh so
yeah that's had a lot of publicity hasn't it [laughter]
well that's what oliver stone's seeking to do and i- i think it's really interesting to look at this because i think it kind of gets at the question of how people get their news sometimes
oh
well it it certainly is and uh that would be a huge concern you know i don't think the general public really realizes this
the fundamental problem is the l- is
uh this house is was built in probably the mid seventies uh it's kind of a brick ranch not a whole lot needs to be done to it we've only we only moved here about a year ago
oh is that right
it's out of sight right it's out of sight
um
so i it's
yeah
right i think it's only fro- um we've had a freeze twice
oh okay
yeah
in dollars and lives and the long term effects
um north vietnamese and viet cong time to adjust to our uh
i don't know what it's called but
uh-huh
from what i've seen the better physicians are quick to ask you to go ahead and get a second opinion
in richardson
that's that is one beautiful place
but uh
oh yes i think it's very clever it's uh funny that you said that for christmas my daughter and i received matching sweat shirts that a friend had made for ours a beautiful christmas design and they were matching and they were lovely
yeah
uh-huh
and i learned some things and i just luckily stumbled in the right area
don't get in trouble at school or we're going to be all over you [laughter]
short house plant pardon
[laughter]
yeah
not that i know of
well
uh back muscles she uses these three pound weights
[laughter]
yeah yeah that's about all i get a chance for between that and um uh bible study as often as i can that's about the bulk of it
what year are you in in computer science
[noise]
uh no we've been doing it ourselves for most of the time uh find that it's
sounds like a good you ready to get started
yeah
and
yeah i'm trying to consider that uh that could do to the plight of general motors and all of that
but i yeah i like colombo probably the best of any of those mystery things
[noise]
yeah i would
but again i can't i really can't complain about that the vacation plan is pretty good
well wha-
my golly how about you larry
um-hum um-hum
that's always the first thing that i ask you know is about their credit and you know would they have to fill out a little credit application with with us and and sometimes i feel very uncomfortable in in doing that
convenience uh [laughter]
um-hum
but we we pay off every month though so we never have to pay interest and we always we never get the the credit cards
however all of my mom's and relatives and family are from utah
uh-huh we finally put ours on tape a few years ago uh there's places now that do that
yeah
there's some really good food that comes out of there i'll tell you
oh no i haven't either my in in fact we're supposed to get out to movies tonight but i don't know what we're gonna go see
what about the one with um arnold schwarzenegger whatever
well there yeah the- there is that problem an- an- but uh i guess that [laughter] that the real the real interesting thing is in the age of television you're going to get so much analysis of it that a that a game really for example yesterday when when andre reid
um
uh-huh
um that i guess they had called him from the school and you know when they start giving you all those standardized tests and everything and you know dad said well you know you're a smart kid so
well i don't think that uh [noise] any of my relatives would really like to go there
um-hum
[noise] hum
and it was i presume you're familiar with that
it seems that way sometimes you wonder if um an economic threat isn't gonna drive people to do things that would be more drastic than if uh they were a little bit more peaceful you know
and in the summer time we have to get him shaved and it's the funniest looking thing you have ever seen
she had always been almost an entirely outdoor cat except we have a little door you know where she could come in
would you go on national television and and uh tell the world that you'd had an affair and you know and your wife and her parents are listening and
what's said and everything and
we uh my family uh and i we lived in colorado up until about three years ago for about fourteen years and and of course that was a great
yeah i have a seventh grader and a fifth grader also
uh-huh
i know have to do a better grouping [laughter] get better frie-
uh i believe probably world war i._i. is when you know the thing started that caused
do you think that the- that these insurance things should be covered on a state basis or u._s. government basis
right
it's on the the time that we spend with our children
it sure makes a big difference doesn't it
yeah
c. b. s.
and it used to be that we got our newspapers in the evening which i liked because that's when i could read it and i felt like it was fresh
and uh you know we caught uh what do you call uh those flat things
[laughter]
and they have on the ba- it's five cents okay it's still five cents and it even shows the states that
yeah
yeah
oh wow
yeah
uh-huh i agree that's a
the people back in america just were hearing about it how it was just such a disaster this is like the last thing he need is is for marty to have a heart attack i mean you'll you'll love it i mean it's it's really great um
uh what's her name julia roberts
hum
yeah
and uh the number of pupils per class has gone up by about fifty or sixty percent
all of these are really irritants and things that we really don't need
even when it um rained and snowed i just braved it and i wore heels anyways because and
uh it's kind of a well i guess a custom down here
um-hum yes
yeah i grew up in a pretty small town and i'm not sure that um
[laughter]
you know
um-hum
uh discovered that the hole was bigger than they thought initially
i see
so whatever industry they do have even though they don't have as much as we have they just like fire away you know
and um
um-hum
and then it it kind of went downhill for about for a couple of coaches and penders has done a good job of getting it back on its feet and doing some you know playing some good basketball but
to make it you know with the the homemade thing
[vocalized-noise] yep
we uh in fact mending i- yo- even kind of has gone by the wayside for s- most for many people if they get a hole in their sark sock
do something that you like to do uh
had a paneling in it dark paneling and and the cabinets were sort of old and it was just dark in here and old cabinets and uh counter tops
yeah well i- i really i think if you [noise] from a [vocalized-noise]
well and as the product of the academy i can tell you you know if it were that good how come they haven't been able to mass merchandise it and deliver it to everybody how come everybody is not the beneficiary of a harvard m._i._t. or stanford education if it's that good and you really
n-
um-hum [noise]
one of the best ones although goo- for people who aren't used to cross country skiing those nordic uh skiing machines give you a real good workout but if you are not used to that some people don't like it because they don't feel like they they have good
fairly close there's only two or three of them that's out of town and out of state
uh-huh
you know yeah
[noise] i
you know write letters to them
right
no that's exaggeration but we had some problems yesterday so
yeah
um-hum i- i- i know a lady that lives in a place similar to that in austin
[noise]
[laughter]
well uh
and i just don't understand that
yeah
uh and there's no control over it uh the accessors just come around and say okay you're assessment just went up twenty thirty percent and uh
[laughter]
yep
uh-huh
yeah you know uh [laughter] i i wouldn't wanna be back in school now i think it uh it's a real challenge and you know um i think maybe the kids need more um
yeah
probably after two years of marriage
or do you send them away to boarding school and if you do that when do you do it and that's a
that we inherited the neighbors uh
huh
and we put a deck in and we landscaped the yard and we put new carpeting in and we put new linoleum in and then we had the ceiling fixed and put a new floor in the bathroom
but as far as not allowing
[noise]
and uh that's so that's why i got confused but
i- i work in a hospital and we see patients
were thinking about some of these things for our parents and it really is uh
right what about politics on it
oh [laughter] i'm not that big on politics i'm not [laughter] that educated on it i'm
yeah
uh the weather wasn't good and it was mostly gambling and that really wasn't what we were there for so
and and the especially the economics uh uh ramifications of whatever is going to happen over there i mean they're like a a quarter of the land mass of the earth
is now gone you know and now we've got y- uh yeltsin who seems like he's a little bit of a hard ball typical
uh [noise]
uh whereas just over the border in the district they they have a real strong gun control law
um
yeah and uh well and up in uh south dakota on the in the missouri river there we've uh tied into a few northern pike and uh
so we're supposed to be talking about
[noise] you go ahead and tell me about your last home repair
[noise]
i have a friend who is working with uh who works with uh travel groups and one of the ones that he's w- worked with was professionals who came in for an aids uh conference in uh california
teaching you know working on the drug problems and the and the sex problems uh rather than trying to cure the people that already have it
uh at uh it's t._c._j._c. tex- tarrant county junior college yeah and it's really it's really enjoyable i like it
i was concerned of the ability of some of the people in the jury to adequately understand
[laughter] i i have a girlfriend that just went through a three year trial
[laughter]
oh
[laughter] really yes i agree with that
oh isn't that wonderful though
personally i think it would be a deterrent if uh they were able to carry this out without many appeals
yeah they pay for it right now yeah
good
are you watching david letterman's show right now
yeah
uh-huh
that might be more motivating um in relation to what you just mentioned if it were somehow of interest to them
that's true
but those are probably the only two magazines i'd get
um-hum um-hum my
very long ago it wasn't
we have we've had fog for about forty days in a row and temperature inversion so but no uh no snow
[noise]
here uh we d- we do recycle our newspapers and give them to the scouts
well i noticed a difference uh we go to the kroger store uh here to take our aluminum cans and i noticed a difference you know i'd be getting perhaps a dollar for whatever i took in and i think the last bunch i took in which i didn't think was much smaller was maybe twenty six cents
well that that's kind of uh i was the brakes didn't feel like they were working and uh peop- uh people were saying you know don't you get rid of it every three years and everything and i really was thinking about that then it was like
um-hum
i think you know who that was
uh-huh
[noise]
well there's other benefits that uh kind of or look at i guess uh need a vacation once in a while most jobs do that
yeah
um-hum
and legislatures in warshin get after they've been there a few terms is unbelievable they get their salary for life health benefits for life
uh life magazine is like that i quit subscribing to that it's just uh magazine i mean pictures and um
you know what i really hate about magazines is those smelly cards that have perfume or cologne
that we've learned a lot
uh-huh
well we've you know we've struggled a lot with it because again uh most of the nursing homes i've been in are very depressing to me
uh-huh
are you serious
i haven't had to take anything back that there was poor quality i took something back that that wasn't quite what i thought it was
uh-huh
so it sounds like uh [noise]
i think it's changed i think that in the last twenty or thirty years there's definitely been an increase in that type of crime
naturally
i didn't do not much at all i went and looked at a g._m._c. i- i went and looked at a little truck because i just i don't need you know much more and um
yeah
um-hum but they do say that swimming is really really good for you you know for every part of your body
for people who want them for legitimate purposes i mean there's seven days or even even i'd even be in favor of a a yeah thirty days i mean you don't need a gun on short notice [laughter]
that's right [laughter]
i have to happen to think you have a big responsibility when you own a pet and that is that the world is not your pet's bathroom [laughter]
you bet
ha-
uh
[noise] -kay how do you feel about it
yeah or out do what's been done [noise]
uh-huh uh-huh
yeah that's the problem and he just says has to be you know i've got a class opening at nine thirty on saturday and you can every once in a while go to a different class but yo- that's when you're supposed to come
uh uh-huh it i- i think it is too it really moves you from one thing to the other without [noise] having to hassle and uh you know even like with you said with the signs have to you know to change
and it's the only way to go [laughter] i painted eight gallons of paint um i i put some stain and stuff on a on a redwood deck i made and i painted the uh
sealed painted
yeah i ima-
oh same here yeah
[noise] oh i didn't know that
um-hum
so they're not uh i think they're mo- uh i would think there there's better quality control on those things you know just because they're small and stamped and there's not very sophisticated
and they just have a blast we put a a life jacket on everybody and then you know just pull them around and
yeah
um-hum um-hum
[vocalized-noise] oh that is that sounds really fun i love those well they have a really fancy boutique out here in ogden utah
really do you mean even with adolescents
um-hum
oh if she's so into what she's doing
uh-huh
yeah
i mean we're all grown all her kids are grown and we have our own families and now if we go through her cabinets she's like well what are you digging for
but
yeah right i [vocalized-noise] yeah i have heard him and uh i didn't think he was a country singer you know i
but uh i guess it's just it depends there's lemons in all of them i guess but uh
[noise]
[noise]
and uh and get to know so all the cousins get to know each other and
uh-huh
so i could wear the same thing every single day and it really wouldn't make any difference so and sometimes i do that it's just very very strange and different
i think it's pretty popular [laughter] i mean it is probably like a huge stereotype but i think it's pretty popular too what kind of music do you like
yeah and and um the doors are pretty good too i can listen to them and the who i- i really like all kinds i
yep
uh-huh uh-huh
yes and he said you need to know how to do all this stuff so i do change my own oil um
well i think that's wonderful i mean [laughter] i think that's great [laughter]
yeah [laughter] little cold for you
right i because i mean i i've always walked fast so i- i don't know i need to get on a some kind of exercise program though because i'm i'm starting
uh-huh
[vocalized-noise]
and
[noise]
that's true
uh-huh
but even then uh i i'd like to think the free weights simulate a live a real world situation better
[laughter]
receive a lot of information on skiing through the skiing magazine
[noise]
um
yes that's what i wear mainly is suits cotton or um gabardine
well bill uh that idea fits me exactly i just retired from uh the university here and that's been the goal of my life was to
and so uh we're thinking about paying them instead of a percentage on salary paying them a percentage on the business they handle so
you're kidding me
but i tell you wh- it's kind of scary uh we bought our company car through an auction a dealer auction and the dealers they they get those things for about half of what they sell them
uh-huh
so uh you kn- i sure you've thought of all this
yeah
and i vowed then that i was not gonna listen to that radio station any more if that d._j. could make such an unedu-
[laughter]
i don't know i- i don't see much of a change happening there i wish they would spend more time together
yeah really
got to find the good classes and things like that
wow
somebody told me that [noise] within ten or twelve years they would be um eligible for parole
um-hum
and a lot of people aren't trying to get out of it but trying to figure a way to live and pay it back
oh i'm not famil- well we live in roy but we haven't is it on nineteen hundred
ben franklin okay
oh well
uh-huh [laughter]
well this was a uh it wasn't a k._o._a. what wa- frazier what was that that we went to in arkansas
not necessarily at mcdonald's but [laughter]
but i think it should be done
[laughter]
it just the minute you get off work you got to run over there change clothes
yeah
yeah sure am
and but i also wanted a hatchback
yes
standing you know and try to decide how we want to invest our money because right now the the uh interest rates on everything seems to be so low that you know i don't really see any benefit over um uh
okay is it because that's what i have too
um-hum
um-hum
the- the- uh i've been extremely we've had three mazdas we've been extremely pleased with our mazdas
[laughter]
um-hum
[noise] they uh then you pay the other people in coupons and i think some of them is in like thirty minute time slots or in hour time slots and you have to do it
that uh
i think a lot of people are trying to reestablish it in all sorts of different ways um you know well okay so we don't have a small town and okay so we move but
but uh we used to live in california and we did a little bit of camping in california not all that much but um enough to get a little flavor for it uh where mostly do you go with your camping
um-hum
and even if you have someone there right at your own house doing that kind of day care you still always have that little worry i'm sure
but i'm um i think eventually i'll start using it for spread sheets and things like that um what do you find that you use yours mostly for
uh-huh well it's getting to be more and more like a macintosh [laughter]
[noise] it was nice talking to you bye-bye now
uh no urine
well i mean now even if you had a false positive i mean they're they're better you can have retests or what do they do test on your hair
hum
that's right that that's right and uh what we do is we keep coming up with ways to hand- i mean i just heard the attorney general or i think it was on [laughter] p._b._s. the other night briefly going by because it made me to angry but he was talking about
this and that and this and that and people sitting on death row for like fifteen years well that's dumb
um-hum
that's right
um on the ille- illegality of um lie detector tests and um you know i feel that lie detector tests are
so he yeah so he wouldn't do it but on the other hand he also doesn't like the sense of loss of control of his personal life
i know that's scary though
god even up in like highland park i don't even think i'd leave it open seems like that'd where they'd really go for the big houses
uh some things we like to do together with our family are um in the summer time we like to go to parks we
uh-huh
uh uh you wouldn't be able to um
um-hum
boy you're you're further ahead here most people are recycling aluminum soda pop and beer cans
oh
and they had that on last week and that's really kind of something to watch uh it's on i think two or three nights for maybe an hour or two
[vocalized-noise]
yeah ye- yep that's righ- right before
[noise] and your wife puts up with that
of plywood
oh no
um-hum
v._w. rabbit and when he when he got it back his um dashboard was sitting in in his front seat [laughter]
yeah
oh yeah well it's it's about a hour north of salt lake so we're out here in the country and we hear a lot of the country music
so
but um
but that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong
even if uh i think even if i had uh
i have a family of five if i had if i had to pay that much responsible for that much debt
we we've been known to spend a lot of money for expediency in things
um-hum
i worked there because my hours and days were the same as theirs and uh i've just
six years ago when my first one turned a year old and
[noise] well we in our country seems to be involved a lot in the mid east what do you what do you think
yeah i- i- i i have very much doubt that
i i keep the books and i'm the one that writes all the um all the bills and stuff and pretty much um i just know what i have to spend no you may not
okay martin do you do any exercise
losing this weight and being firm and healthy [laughter]
[noise]
yeah
uh and i believe they don't pick up the plastic i think it's the two categories you talked about it's just newspapers bottles cans
uh
um-hum [noise] it
yeah
the and you know it was seat belt law and it it didn't even hardly
uh
i ju- basically my views i guess they tend to be more economically oriented in that i just
all they could do was testify about
yeah
we have one dog [laughter] but it's good we- she- looking for part-time work just to try off to pay off her car
uh you were going to talk about child care
yeah
but to begin with you know when they first i mean she would know us you know and we'd go to visit her but then
um-hum
quite a few of the children are in baby food
um
and uh in fact if you remember the the theme from the beverly hillbillies
uh
um-hum yeah i'm not sure i- i don't i think they only carry one bag when i when i've seen people out there you know
well i would expect they ought to be more sensitive than they are or something i think that's one of the things people think of cutting back on but it certainly would be a way to save money [noise] um
everyone really knows isn't going to make a real difference but they're sort of left not knowing what else to do than everything they can do
yeah
yeah
uh-huh
not to excess in any case [laughter]
i
oh [laughter] oh well that's neat that she's in good health and that at that age
[laughter]
and then do you know that number and then how many own a a freezer separate from
um
me too [laughter] the last thing they need at that age is academics [laughter]
it is
they just there's a joy i think in changing the settings
um
[noise]
[noise]
oh
the uh very generous vacation time and sick time we get
okay yeah it's true i feel that um you know i don't feel that uh we're paying too much taxes provided we get the right services for what we pay for but i think we've kind of gotten away from that
no although i get some things that i very much appreciate i mean i don't i don't have a dictator i don't i'm not reporting for a dictator i live in a free economy and so i mean in a sense i don't mind spending money on
and the and the individual's guilty i believe that if we have cash capital punishment that it should be executed swiftly
you have to kind of take that with a grain of salt too
that seems to be
yeah somewhat that but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have uh
okay i was just going to say i think one of the biggest thing for me is like the room for advancement
[noise]
uh i am not sure right now i think he is keeping he has it uh kind of a forecast out for oh about the next uh eighteen months or so he keeps track of all of um
be with the kids a little bit during that time and
[laughter] i mean do you do you feel they're they're swayed more to- are you talking about with criminal or civil suits
i would feel more comfortable in many cases i think with judges uh you know doing the sentencing
well it is because when we think about it and it isn't at all reassuring
[noise] oh yeah yeah
oh they the were just punishing they didn't think far enough ahead i don't guess that you know that he would actually die or that they would get caught they had two of them
[vocalized-noise]
so it kind of put the uh salesmen at bay put it that way
uh-huh
i- i- i- i
cereal boxes and everything but you have to drive it downtown and so you know my kitchen i mean certainly i don't like anyone to ever come in because i've just got this stuff everywhere i don't drive it every day so i've got just piles of it
you have a real high sales tax there if i recall
booze uh butts cigarettes beds uh hotel room tax bellies a meal tax and bets uh gambling
yeah
that's pretty pretty sad or who killed who
um-hum
oh yeah
you know the little the pieces from that they cut out from making the envelopes
yeah he's uh a a one owner
i don't happen to be in the part of the city that does that though
but where you end up having a savings is at your landfill last so much longer
they got to have a problem
right
yeah i just don't i just don't understand these people you know that like when they they decide they're going to buy a gun to protect themselves they go out and buy a three fifty seven magnum which is going to shoot through you know
you know if you're not going to teach me how to do it and if i am not going to you know be responsible enough to go out and learn i don't need it
hm
uh i don't know if that's an excuse for not having a tight budget but i basically
uh every six months i have to pay my taxes so i take a set amount i've got a money market account that i do a lot of uh saving in and i also have got a checking account besides that but
oh yeah
oh okay
oh really
so i i'm beginning to see some uh real positive effects i mean huh although i won't claim tha- that the that that we're doing everything and it's uh you know i i try to recycle uh papers and cans
[noise]
right they can go and
right more more or less for large businesses than small businesses i think mostly go on personal contacts and who knows who and what people they know would say about them
i think there's a lot that could be done to improve them i uh
[laughter]
if if there were a tax credit then everybody would get it regardless who they worked for and you you would also be better in the sense that that people who had only one income in the family would get as much as people who had two and you would sort of think that the people who have one income kind of need it more
right
well it they have something that
well what about you and your own background di- did your mother or father stay home or di- did they work or
um-hum
a uh society where uh everything is a is uh regulated
of heavy industry yeah i think i think the [vocalized-noise] has been you know relatively good about
you know to uh ba- kind of balance out he says if it's not air pollution it'll be
and so we could see where every penny went and it was really interesting to see
you know we tend to fudge on the budget a little bit it's just to uh uh get out the money in advance and put it in uh
yeah i'm here
do you like any bluegrass
uh
you know i like more of the real new ones
right
okay
um-hum
if that shouldn't be capital punishment but if they're the high ones that are making these drugs and importing them i think that you could consider that because in essence they're taking lives
yeah that was uh i enjoyed my time but you know met my husband and met him there so it was uh
that's great
yeah and it's more than even paper or something like that there's more energy in it per pound or whatever
you almost like to have some place that's almost hospice care but a little bit more independent than that almost almost like a community that has partly something like condominiums
well more or less but he is almost to the point that he's legally blind so that really is what bothers us uh he could start a fire just about anything [laughter] could happen
well that's the theory um
progressive um i- it's like um you know a graduated tax which means you pay more money as you earn more money so you have a greater ability to pay you don't really need that extra income to survive
um i used to but it got too expensive so
yeah
uh drug treat- yeah drug treatment and alcohol and yeah that's the same thing here even if you're
um but we have actually quite an extensive network of collecting uh newspapers they're actually at
to need uh get there and to participate in the activities
and sports
uh um actually uh i was kind of interested if you found out about the study by uh reading telecom digest or was there another
um-hum
we're trying we're trying
yeah that's correct that's correct
and i- i when i ride the bike m- ride my bike to campus i i have it on on my walkman and that gives me one side of the news and to get the other side i get a bunch of news letters from organizations which are mostly on the right
yeah like like you i of- i rarely spend time watching news on t._v. the uh
and they i believe they give discounts o- on drinks if you have this cup so that's kind of incentive
yeah um [noise] i would personally like it if my parents
uh know what to do with them and they don't wanna take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home
uh-huh
my husband races cars
there's all kinds of
i think we don't have capital punishment either
[noise]
now that her kidneys have totally failed they've taken her off one of the drugs lasix which is a diuretic it it changes how the kidneys absorb moisture
uh-huh
it
mostly i've mostly been in the east coast so that's going between atlanta washington d._c. area
right that uh i just i just pay you you know more taxes than than i can imagine if i could get i've got a little piece of property
you have to go an- and here you go pee in the bottle an- and we get somebody and we can watch you pee in the bottle and we'll see if i- if if i- if it what happens this time and they they just [noise] that the testing p- part of it is just really bad
well yeah
do you ev- d- you ev- did you ever see those big old coke bottles you know the glass ones that were like they were kind of green
i'm not sure that drug testing is strictly aimed to catch people
perhaps as a um
right well we have it once a week they just started it not too long ago and we have newspaper and glass and then like a very select group of [laughter] plastics
are you
um so you can choose all these different plans some of which pay you know like everything and some of which pay very little uh you can also choose an h._m._o.
um-hum
well mc- lehrer mcneil and lehrer i guess he's leaving one of them is leaving [vocalized-noise]
yeah this is the first i'd seen of it too um actually i was kind of i'm su- kind of surprised that that
well i'm not sure whether you're the lucky one or i am [laughter] because i have done it and uh
um-hum
oh
yeah
it's almo- i can't imagine having to go into real complicated stuff and making
i don't have too many weaknesses but i found out a credit card was one of them
okay uh let's see when it comes to to uh sentencing i i'm a little confused because the the only things that i read about sentencing
uh i'm a research engineer i work uh f- with georgia tech
and i see kids already that are gonna be criminals
yeah
[laughter]
i don't know when you're when you're used to one thing i guess something different always seems like it would be fun to have or nice to have
yeah i read that in the paper the other day
well have you ever done any remodeling
you know your a a [vocalized-noise] a sixty two year old guy is less likely to be
uh reading ability or something or other and things like president bush's uh statements to the public and they were comparing him with michael dukakis back during the old uh
[laughter]
perhaps not i- it's it's it th- they they really didn't you know it it sounds like they're some kind of liberal group well they were a little bit liberal on some things but they were a little bit conservative on some things too
i i miss that
they were kind of starved for real information i think at that point because all they had was was military clips and
yeah yeah but it it b._m._w.'s good for that what kind of driving just like commuting you'd want to do it use it for
so i'm ki- yeah i'm not sure if i really want
we don't regret paying taxes we do think that uh sometimes uh we have a reverse of a regressive tax a progressive tax
oh and it its it slides in a window across the bottom
they have a dow jones segment there where it covers us uh you know some most active stocks uh general average
well i'll tell you one thing i found with with pets um i- i think cats
uh yeah you know an interesting story is i- i- i have a friend who has um a cat that actually knows how to open tender vittles bags
oh it was a it was a
well um i know so- in some of the one of the smaller towns around dallas they started curbside recycling
which is nice and the rule is that anything that comes in the newspaper even the slick uh ad inserts they'll pick up and that's great
[noise]
[noise] oh
[noise] because that's where all the d- the gangs get their power over the drugs because it's illegal
oh yeah
yeah it's uh she's been a real good a real good dog and uh just it's kind of a shame that i'm i'm go- i'm away from it now i- i j- i actually live in florida
and uh
um-hum
oh yes yes
uh-huh
i think as parents we really enjoy them and in our own personal situation our children have not yet decided to rebel [laughter] i'm su- i'm sure that's coming though but they're wonderful kids
if we really wa- if it was really seriously gonna be a de- deterrent i would think that it would be public i mean i don't think it would be
uh you know they're not going to do their job which is the whole the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or or or uh let go based on whether or not the person whether or not the evidence says that there's enough
oh really
yeah
um
um
yeah well what about uh
[laughter]
i know the taxes are a lot higher
okay only when you draw it out
uh-huh
yes
[noise] yeah actually through electronic mail
how do you feel about setting like well for example a a car type accident where
if it's a company you know that they're insured unless the award is so staggering that it goes all beyond their layers of insurance
and try and figure out for the for the year whether we're going to be able to to cover the unusual expenses such as property taxes and others things that come up from time to time
yes
i think that's good
what about um
um-hum
[noise] see i'm trying to decide my dad was in the military which is i guess if you figure companies the military would be a pretty big company
you could create or maybe create is wrong but advocate a societal imperative that would have the same goal how could you make it uh
and i'm not sure we'd we'd want it [vocalized-noise]
uh-huh
um-hum
yeah and you know even there you have to watch out for you know you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and you know the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry
right yeah
the kind of [vocalized-noise] the way they do it
sh- she's from ireland
no i haven't heard her
uh-huh
you know they wanna find out how come butterflies do fly and all other kinds and i think that's kind of stupid
[noise] you know it seems to me like the minute you starting putting in any radical changes in anything you end up with something like um liberia or [laughter] uh czechoslovakia you know i mean it seems like
uh-huh
sure everybody gets off of work [laughter]
and i like to ride my bicycle so when the weather's okay you know i can do that but um you know having to
is for us repair record and the g- and the gas mileage is what drives it for us uh not whether it has a moon roof or uh how many c._d. players you can stack in it but
um-hum
um-hum
well white paper's bad too they they treat it too
do they do like wh- what about like um what kind of plastic stuff can you recycle do you know
they ended up in this place where they hadn't seen a white face in like you know seventy five years
oh yeah
three months or something like that since that happened so
oh yeah so they have a toehold a good toehold
right uh-huh
he is it's uh just me and my wife and uh he's kind of our temporary substitute for having kids i gue- we treat him like our kid right now so he's spoiled rotten
huh when he gets outside does in does he run away and then eventually come back or
uh-huh
well i- i actually live in new hampshire
uh-huh
uh
oh no no no she had a stroke about two years ago she's blind
i live downtown and the neighborhood's pretty rough and i like the um the idea of having a a good mean strong dog around we've had some in the past and it's really paid off
[laughter] schnauzers in particular probably [laughter]
are they really i don't think i've ever seen one
[vocalized-noise]
siberian husky and a springer spaniel
[noise] okay an en- a siberian husky and an english springer spaniel
well you know when you come over the woodrow wilson bridge and you come ar-
oh for the last uh
uh just put a my that's weird i just put it on hold and i heard what sounded like a modem on the other line that was calling us up
okay want to go ahead and start then
yeah [laughter]
[laughter]
i haven't been in the the job market for
e- effort at all
right
you know and so many of these things takes so many years to develop that we've never you know it'll be past my life time before i see the effects of some of the things that we're doing now
uh-huh
uh we we and we get the really local papers here so can find out what the school board's doing and things like that
and it's hardly considered you know here it is uh a an elec- election year and you hardly hear anything about it
well at least you're not down to cat food
a lot of people frown on that just on on t._v. in general but i don't know i- i think my own personal opinion is that it it helps to instill a sense of values and moral as long as it could be ex- explained and as long as there's good monitoring going on
so um and i will tell them that's not acceptable behavior that's not right we don't do that so um and we don't watch um
well frank um generally i keep on up oh listening to radio news uh listening to some television news uh the rest of it i guess what everybody's talking about um
but i think a lot of it could be handed over to the states you know especially things like welfare and and you know food stamps that kind of programs um so
[laughter]
and to use uh the fact that you could leverage this and really only pay for a small fraction of it by virtue of having federal funds seems to me to be a good example of why
[laughter] oh wow
so my my football experience down here in florida has been very bad when i was in michigan i loved to go watch u. of m. play uh i played high school football
um-hum
a full size pickup
and then later on we're going to try to get a uh
okay
[noise] couple of things though that i did think of there where um
i mean that
[noise]
no i haven't but uh you know lo- you know looking around it does seem like a roomy
um-hum
i don't know if uh if that containment policy was was right or the best
and it it seems th- there are a lot of profession now it seems like
you know
[noise]
[laughter] yeah that's true actually i'm i'm kind of interfa- interested in uh i'm a human factors person
like an intel chip would but uh it it like i said i- i- i consider g._u._i.s as a great equalizer you know they help people work but they seem to bring all of the machine to there knees
and [noise]
yes yes yes we still pay that i suspect it's not quite a higher percentage as you may pay
oh
and they're all clean and you want to hang them up and
you know if the kinds of essential not only am i choosing the kind of schooling that they're getting but i am also choosing the other kinds of children who are going to be there because
um
uh just regular normal person that just using it for hunting and stuff shouldn't have to pay for other people mistakes
but
that's interesting
cats which are uh pretty unusual cats
there also in areas up their that mandated uh separating your garbage
but well they've they've got trucks for part of the city and and they haven't gotten enough trucks you know manufactured yet to take care of the whole city of plano
right
and
yeah well i guess
rather steep i guess
belief but [vocalized-noise] the main part is uh
not very many [vocalized-noise] learned how to do that
but she um she was from a really good family too of of dog you know if that's you know whatever you want to call it but
where as in a company like this it's very fragmented
i think you did
[laughter]
yeah and that what that what started it with a little bit of back trouble i was having and of course i didn't want to do leg lift or anything [laughter]
each one fill like they [vocalized-noise]
and often here uh people
yeah
um-hum
and uh that's one thing that really bothers me down here they say that uh
oh coffee and tea and uh uh spring water hot and cold and soups and that's
uh-huh
um
when you come in the house and he
w- that's good
well you can you know like a well civic is is like a corolla or something it it's
yep um-hum
right
because no matter where you go you there isn't going to be uh mommy to get you up or anything else you know
i think i- i- it the placement could have been delayed had there been
for some reason
[noise]
oh
and then there they are doing it too
so we were amazed when we you know recycling's one of these things that we did kind of once and awhile but it was
and they had uh clear glass and colored glass
they're real new
yeah he's great
um-hum
uh but i like i like listening to jazz although i'm kind of ignorant about it and uh i like listening to classical although i'm kind of ignorant about it
what do you listen to
uh
well we uh we needed you know something that was kind of convenient to uh
we're probably the same age [laughter]
and we just kind of like you say if we need to watch it we watch it and and not spend any you know big amounts of money uh
we actually have a private sanitation company that asks us to separate out all of our stuff and they take everything from car oi- you know engine oil
more opportunities because there're so many things going on within the company
well [noise] party of m- part of my reason for coming to california was california
hm
yeah
um i really don't know exactly where i stand just to be honest i have mixed feelings about it and i've thought about both positions i would like to have the freedom
with your guns
i i don't know i think that the founding fathers had a great idea and th- r- the reason that we went away from the single judge or the the the triad i guess of judges that they have uh in some systems it just um
uh he's going to be completely responsible for this only because he happens to live right there with with my in-laws
well i don't know it's uh it's hard to say it's th- there's nothing i could it didn't seem like there was much i could do about it
right
like a uh uh
but they're a lot of work too [laughter]
but now i'm training to run and i i fun run here in tyler and it's just two miles but um i'm up to running a mile so i walk real fast for two miles which takes me about thirty minutes
yeah that's true are you a member of a club or anything is that where you go lift weights are you a member of a club or
oh yeah we do believe me there's nothing like having a kid to chase that'll [laughter] do it for you
um-hum
one of the reasons i run uh probably the biggest reason either run or play racquetball i mean either of them is um because if i don't get exercise i don't i don't sleep well and i just don't feel as good i just feel kind of yucky
and i had to do all this to play it you know to get things under control
yeah
i- i mean i- it it
yeah
yeah
[vocalized-noise] i guess that was it um
well uh
uh yeah [laughter] and i had the wrong shoes i've just started running i i been into weigh lifting and all and i just started running and i had the wrong tennis shoes
oh really
[laughter] well yeah it sounds like you got all holes over the place now the guys that
yeah it has it's it's i- you know it had it's had its good times and bad times but for the most part yeah i think it's pretty good
are weeks off o- off of it and until you take care of a person personally there were three my mom and i and our kids would help us some and it was just awful to take care of a person that is that way
and by spreading thin you mean they too many students or too many subjects per teacher or
and i don't think that uh
hey there you go [laughter]
yeah
huh
and i did try it once i'm hopele- i'm not even i can't do anything with my right hand but i did try using right handed clubs once and i- it was so awkward for me
uh some come up with some sort of majority maybe um uh maybe a two thirds or a three quarters majority or something because it's
you know of
but i would say that every uh couple of weeks uh we're together with one of the you know one of the kids sometimes we have uh family get togethers probably every oh
married life uh before our daughters were born and uh w- we pretty much i- it seems like our whole life is devoted to the girls
[noise]
i like um u._s._a. today
yeah
sounds fair
you know
i don't really see the need for it um typically only thing that ever gets pro- you know that occurs when you have one is you end up shooting some family member or some kid in the house
um-hum
but you have to take time off and and go take your child to to well baby care on top of that now the the general cold and sniffles and and the first year illnesses
and it they came out with the mac 2 which is a whole lot more useful than any other macintosh tha- that had come out and they also came out with hypercard
and
we had to sit there and listen to all the dumb things that they did and i felt sometimes like saying why don't you people just
that's right and uh it makes it very uh
expenses and pay the bills with the rest of it [laughter]
um-hum
he ended up killing himself but if he had survived
three years okay
i mean that testing can be really bogus you know because we knew people in uh the home schoolers associations there that just they were just blatant cheaters and i mean if their kid didn't do well yeah i mean they just filled it out themselves it was absurd you know
the way i'm approaching this is it's tough to defend half of the playing field if you don't defend the whole playing field you know
um-hum
and uh provide in home day care uh more or less to give my wife you know a break in the afternoons to uh go out and run errands and do things
they had plans for these things and they sent them up years and years ago and they never expected them to be still transmitting data back
or i i think california had a uh i- i [noise] i think she it was a female uh judge i think she was like the
oh [laughter]
yeah i mean i think yeah again if i- if the if it was used efficiently and people you know worked on on real problems as opposed to just sort of make work
i just had it uh oil oil change and lube done to it but before that about two weeks ago somebody busted out my w- my passenger window so i had to go get it replaced
um-hum
uh
right
it's not really stressful at all in any i mean it's it's fun and it's enjoyable and it's good exercise but
that used to bore bore me to tears you know i'd love to swim if it was water polo or
what do they what do they do to you in the military if you get caught what do they do to you if you get caught
so i- it was really to their advantage to get caught and
how can i better say it you know when a material object is destroyed it is a portion of one's life that's consumed if you look at it that way
[noise]
it's important to me if i was married and had children
right
that's pretty well into the tee- you know in the teenagers
it's kind of uh it's kind of a hard thing to to talk about having a limited experience base i mean i fix things around here rather than uh rather than bother a landlord with it i'll you know repair a sink or um
i'm an adult but i'm going back to school and everywhere on the campus where i write a check it's they want soc- security numbers on everything and i just go bananas
[laughter] yeah right or put them on hold yeah
right
you know minimum requirement of time commitment that uh
[laughter] ye- i never thought of that that'd probably work [laughter]
now we uh
uh-huh
right right and some of them you know they have uh uh one click where you where it goes up and it's li- not on on some of the some but this one did not
[noise]
uh wordperfect
well just for a little bit of typing and stuff i work for i do tech support for a company that makes telephone equipment
yep and the kids ended up the losers i think
uh [laughter]
well that a- as as opposed to the kind of the more european political prisoners where someone actively uh speaks out and opposes the government i- i- i- if a crime involves no complainant
but you can't unfortunately you can't do anything about that except get rid of the budget deficit and
yeah
like t._v. or
that's your curr- current event
well i mean
[laughter]
techno dance um you know electronic compilations things like that uh really alternative and and progressive music
hum hum
um-hum
so uh so so perhaps the connection with it wasn't there uh
and it's hard to keep them honest when they're there for a long time
i think a massing too much information there's it's just an intrusion into
you know and so it's obviously that there's not you could've decided okay i'm going to stop now and may have stopped for three months and still it would show up in these tests and that's completely unfair
yeah you know
no i do not none that i'm aware of anyway as they say um
but
[noise]
criminal trials are more of do the facts say that this happened or didn't it happened
million and millions of dollars that i couldn't do a damn thing with anyway
not to use chemicals that im- can impair their behavior in a job
[laughter] yeah uh my parents when i was growing up they they were always buying and buil- buying land and building houses because
yeah i i i find it enjoyable uh
[noise]
exactly yes
um apparently they have plenty of time
easy to sustain maintain if you just simply continue to exercise your mind [noise]
[laughter]
um
well you so you're saying you thought uh that well that that implies to me that you would you should've felt like it should've been uh turned over to a commercial market
yeah it's it's kind of a thing where you get the hang of it after a while you know um just kind of get a feel for the wind and how it works and and the physics behind it
i didn't know that
somebody you can't even live with if they
is that minnesota
yeah
[laughter]
you pay taxes to support it and then uh you pay to get in too
yeah yeah i c- i think in terms of computer terminology i look at you know price performance and things like that
okay
uh you know worry about uh academics or anything like that and [noise] so i'm i'm really kind of happy about that end of of things it's uh
well needless to say here in washington d._c. [laughter] this is the war zone
yeah
something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago
but they pretty much go through that and
they think they're going to be saving lots of money on repainting and having the car last that much longer no because they want it to look really sharp
i actually really like uh jeep cherokees uh-huh
right
seems kind of crazy
taxing
i don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care
i guess
so you've never had
uh and every time you take one of those tests you know when you're submitting a sample
you know what might very well do uh cause a uh a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that is to
[laughter]
you know se- tra- separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it you know
did they
in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening in fact they'll [laughter] have these little parties and people will just get i mean i've my brother lives near where i work and i have many a time called him to come get me you know and um
and i- i don't know i wonder if there are other crimes uh a repeated rapist for example or
[laughter]
[noise] not that um
that that histor- for some reason historical sites with you know the the full federal money and everything
well down in texas uh you know little listen to a little country every now and then
yeah that's what it it was
uh [laughter] i really don't even keep up with the college teams that much you know
um-hum
oh okay
is your boss willing to let you
exactly
um and my my company has a uh a pretax medical deduction uh medical and uh child care uh all together so
what kind of what make is the mini van
and uh drug use well actually drug use is probably a misdemeanor but
they they have that down here in florida still they have the electric chair
might make you feel better but [laughter]
well that must be pretty bad [noise]
so how do you keep up
right
yeah
yeah
they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to um
but you know i'm happy with what they're in so
yeah
but uh [laughter] they uh most of the time [vocalized-noise] pretty careful shopping anyway i get pretty good stuff i think that uh aside from the fact all markets being internationalized and if you want to buy american it takes real extra work to find
yeah but i i have to say i think all o- overall things are in instead of the unstability in the area are actually sta- more stable than they were before because
but one thing i didn't know is that
when i changed those over i put on these these pressed aluminum things
[noise] but man it is just uh really expensive two years ago it was two hundred dollars for the basic uh major medical and the next year it was four hundred you know it doubled in a year like that
so that'll be at three sixty a year
[noise]
[noise] possibly buy something like that um
oh i see
i'm uh i- i work for i'm an electronic technician i work at uh for a university uh georgia tech uh research
and it would be very hard for me because i wouldn't have i wouldn't have any idea of how much money i was spending in one month now i have know exactly what i'm spending and it is so much
right
um
is it a pretty lar- so it must be a pretty large percentage still that experiment with drugs right
you set down you look at consumer reports we been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the u._s. auto
sure
does she have a home or an apart-
seems to like it there a lot and stays really active and
uh-huh it is expensive
[noise]
let's see about ten years ago
right
well i know it's split federal and so forth
we also well no we have a uh an excise tax on cars our car tags are very expensive average taxes are very low on real estate probably in the five to six hundred dollar a year range
right
[noise]
yeah
then they start getting uh other people to the people do these phonathons and they call you up
[noise]
do you do all your own tune-ups and stuff
is ninety two years old
often times they even have mental difficulty with senility or alzheimer's disease or those [noise] or or physical and mental handicaps
[noise] okay
uh
[laughter]
especially if you have an interest group that comes up with a study that supports their own position if they did the work i always tend to be a little suspicious of it and that might've been the southern poverty law project or something that did that
uh finding of uh guilt
to make the decision as to what the actual penalty will be
[noise]
yeah
generally at least in my own experience when i purchase something mail order it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania it's because
a friend here in town just recently helped a um third grader with his science fair project [noise] and he was describing some of the interaction
um-hum
uh-huh
[noise]
[laughter]
small less than eight hundred thousand dollars then you terminate him of course one of the things that happens if you use that algorithm is you find that it's more easy it's easier to uh to uh
yeah that appeals process i mean it's what you know really
[noise]
right
sort of remodeling a house out in downtown atlanta in candler park and uh
um and we budget we're our our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby so we're budgeting um each month um an allowance for his education starting now
[vocalized-noise] well a lot of that um i don't know how safe it is i guess um we keep it all in a safe here at the house
uh you know sort of sort of maybe from elementary through uh high school you know just sort of to get a feel for what it's like
once once it seemed i got into high school they had a lot of uh acc- accelerated programs and all kinds of stuff like that and that mean tha- that makes a big difference because uh when you're when you're taking classes with uh
but no no money for supplies
um-hum
[vocalized-noise]
unregulated and and
yeah
yeah
i've tried to get tickets to the pops concert uh series next year along with the symphony
you had good luck with that one huh
is it an accord
overall the the benefits of of uh volunteer service
yeah
incredible
oh is that that's that's a pretty good hobby isn't it
hum
[laughter]
uh i don't really know i'm a math computer science major right now
we have a lot of wood smoke
yeah in the in the stream or a river
i see
but you have to attract you know you have to attract so many people just to come to vote they don't have to vote for you but they have to come to the polls and actually vote
you said you have a couple of changes do the kids get attached to one person and then it's a problem to wean them off them
which in the paper it's just um newspaper and corrugated cardboard is the only thing you're supposed to put in there no slicks um
oh okay yeah
no
uh
but they
listening pleasure uh with something of that nature i put on mozart or beethoven something that will evoke a response
well probably the biggest concern that i would have now is getting safe drinking water um
my my grandmother is um
where they have a total ban you know in northern ireland yeah tha-
but
[vocalized-noise]
i mean i know that i would never not do my homework because lightning would strike me something terrible would happen
yes
campus campus yeah [laughter] yeah yeah that's that's that's another that's another thing too
yeah
we- you dadgum right if you know
so uh i i guess it's subject is uh gun control
well it's a powerful lobby i mean i've debated issues um on some other issues regarding the cable t._v. and that and uh the n._r._a. lobby is the most powerful that's up there in capitol hill and uh they do a number
yeah i'd heard something as a matter of fact uh kind of along those lines with i think it was the new york school system
[noise]
uh we all learned how to uh properly handle guns and have the proper amount of respect for them you know we did the hunter safety training and that kind of thing um and
yeah i uh i went through the same thing i
yeah
and yeah to me it is i mean i work and i pay my taxes and i lived out in texas for a little while and they're
they have oh a bank of maybe six jogging machines they have a a um [noise]
we have these stores up here that do the same thing as far as bottles and that if they're not washed out
[noise] not so much because uh it's bad per se
that's true i've noticed that
well it could be a game of scrabble an- or it could be you know reading a book out loud or making up a story and passing it around the table you know one sentence to each person
did you drive there
i mean i've heard of things like you know making them
now uh you know if they ever
oh yeah wasn't that that thing in [vocalized-noise] minneapolis or something when they were supposedly smashed out of their minds and then flew or they had their light
[laughter] well th- doesn't that seem sort of uh
how about you
right
[laughter]
right right yes i do i i have been thinking about this you're about the tenth person they tried to call for this [laughter] so i've had lots of time to think but yes i do because um
unfortunately though it does string out the uh process but you know
why is that
oh
yeah i- i believe they should too
well i'm not see i i i take time and uh uh uh off and on during my life i've taken uh good housekeeping
not careful not to mention finding the time to read them it's even hard for me i'd i have mail buckets full of magazines i haven't had a chance to look at yet
and they always compare [noise] uh america they say well in america we have uh you know a gun problem and uh uh that
slip in slip out you know they know exactly what they're going for so i've heard that's really on the rise as far as um you know a new type of crime
huh
yeah what
well i- i should clarify i work in the i'm an artist and i work in the art department so perhaps they are a little more bohemian
no actually i try to stay behind the scenes which means i wear slacks and uh
okay um
no [laughter] not really
every week i've got to have my t._v. guide
uh-huh
yeah
so i don't know and i- i think it could be used to hassle somebody if someone was out to get you
y- yeah well i- i- i don- i don't know we we also uh my wife and i uh uh volunteer to go to a uh nursing home that's a just a mile from our house we um
well [laughter] actually right now i'm a full time college student so my dress code is very very ex- yeah i usually wear jeans and stuff to classes or shorts in the summertime but over the summers i've had a job internships with the newspaper
how shall i say it they know you're there but they don't uh you don't there's no notice at all but when i wore a suit that day uh [noise]
yeah when i when i applied for my gold mastercard they said well you have to close this other mastercard out too and i said you mean the one i closed two years ago
really
and uh
so that's make up most of the laboratory
[laughter] that's right tell me about it i was in i was on a down in downtown washington sunday when half a million people were demonstrating
[noise]
sure i suppose you watch for hurr- hurricanes coming in and
how much
yeah
[laughter]
[noise]
yeah [noise]
you know you hear these guy i think that this is the first election i've heard about where a lot of the incumbents are really f- saying okay we're getting out because it's too much heat
um-hum
but you know the again in the future we're going to see the same type of thing even in more white collar work where we're going to have job security i think being the biggest focus
um-hum
and uh they're cutting back so i don't go in all that often but
[noise]
uh-huh
take her back because she was being a a you know a a nuisance or worse than a nuisance i mean sh- she sort of went you know bananas and they couldn't couldn't deal with her
the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened there was somebody there for them
we
um i have one but i haven't really had a chance to talk to her about that for a while
[noise]
sure
right
what generally tends to happen i mean the u. s. would be actually declining in population slightly if it weren't for the fact that we have continuation large scale immigration into the country
generally i get most of my news from uh the radio and then sometimes um if i've got time i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper and just fall off on the articles that i like
and i ended up taking a secretarial school summer class for graduate college graduates which it struck me as so s-
um-hum
oh not too large that's part of the problem with the uh the health care program it's prob- maybe uh twelve people
[vocalized-noise]
and he offered you know to take me to one of the games because apparently he'd bought uh he and four other people from honeywell had bought a seat or a row of seats actually
it was comforting to know that you had it but but
huh
you know i build boxes as people say
did anybody come from out of state
[laughter] but uh we're trying to get my mother's go- you know trying to get my mother's family going because my grandmother just died
yeah and then i can also you know do some crafts and sell those at garage sales
my um roommate does sew some and and um
right
yeah maybe uh they have a problem [laughter]
yeah
well who knows uh
but that's it but that's that's probably the worst my daughter has a charm bracelet i bought her that's guaranteed
[laughter]
yeah
right
oh sure
i guess we're in the situation that a lot of am- you know middle class americans are in
[noise] oh so
well foot-
that show up at this family reunion
uh-huh
[laughter]
um-hum
um-hum
i'm a technologist uh and i in the past have done a great deal of of uh system development just through uh software development programming
hm
sure
uh then there's the- there's the whole question that that a that a work force that is known not to be on drugs is gonna be more healthy i don't think anybody would argue with that
it's not it's not quite the bargain that a guy would think [noise]
um-hum
right
um-hum
and the christian view is to forgive you know and uh
personally cannot see any use for them other than uh f- for for o- like people who just like have some sort of crazed
yeah that that's pretty they have some pretty obscure international news i mean like coming up next a five minute report on nepal you know [laughter]
uh less support of uh
i kind of would like the idea of having a 401k or something that i could you know contribute to and get some matching contributions
and for me there's absolutely no question what's the most important benefit
so [noise] and uh
i have a thirteen year old daughter and so we go bike riding and it's nice we get to spend some time together rather than i go to the gym while she does her homework so i've enjoyed that part of it yeah
uh helps out the the it's a cha- the chan- the change of pace and just getting out and around an- and i find that i can often you know often uh when i get around to doing it then i i feel better when i get back to work and the and uh
ah
so you know it's not exactly that kind of a place that that that you wanna you know get into a tax revolt situation
no i'm not [laughter] no i- i don't work i'm a student i go to school i'm in nursing school
sure
um-hum
[laughter]
the kids only wear name brand things to school and it's one of these things well it does you know it really does because i'm a single mom and i have a thirteen year old now and uh you know it does i mean we do it to a point but um
hum
i'm i- where we are here um i you know the biggest crimes seem to be you know theft and drug related stuff lately um in the inner city section o- rochester
something that might occur in the court system for those that are troubled
uh and i i think that uh that there there's something that has to be changed in the system to to do that i i think capital punishment uh uh laws are probably stringent enough but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
sure
yeah
not so much they climates out
oh really
that's right [laughter]
you know
right
uh-huh
um-hum um-hum well those travel magazines are that more or less show you different countries that you could go to or
okay
his check once a month pays all the bills my check weekly buys groceries and gas and you know that kind of thing and it works out real well that way so we don't run into a lot of problems
and i'm sure someday i'll probably get back but uh at the current time
yeah
yeah
yeah i do too uh of course
[vocalized-noise] i- i think politics you have to be real interested in power
oh god we certainly do
right
right
yeah
right anything with an a you know if you drink a lot of caffeine or yeah somebody was saying telling me if you drink it in you know an awful lot of caffeine that that can show up as a positive test
well that's exactly what i was going to say now there seem to be really three reasons for education one is education for civic duty one is education for economic reasons and one is education for civilization i mean and i- i think that one is
[laughter]
what was the age difference between the oldest and youngest
so it's really my parents and i have five children three are married and they have little kids
[laughter]
oh yeah yeah we did a lot of different things we'd stop when we wanted to that kind of stuff so a we kind of did a little bit of hiking sure and a little bit of uh sightseeing uh i- different areas uh
anymore but it it uh
yep [laughter]
and stuff see you're from california is that right
um-hum
we should do it because [vocalized-noise] for the for the return we get for it and uh
yeah
yeah my my grandmother is not in a nursing home but she's in a [noise] oh they're like um they're apartments for senior citizens
when she can't take care of herself
yeah
oh is that right
sounds great [laughter]
and uh max lucado
frankly i think that the reason that we're in so much trouble and and and it's such an anticompetitive um
well that's a good idea do you think this is true of all women i seem to have been in debt when my husband and i got married too
yeah you have a tendenc- that's a tendency to do it when you can
yeah it's jus-
would allow
stuff in the eighties
i'm prepared
for this type of work you know it's just uh and i guess that's that's pretty far-fetched as benefits go
another thing is a lot of times you know they aren't that accurate or they aren't that sensitive like if you're on a prescription drug of some kind you know what are they gonna do about that [laughter]
uh th- they test you um before they before you start or before you even interview or
uh caught his interview last night with david frost and it was the the first time i had you know heard um you know his views expressed by himself i had heard other people talk about what they thought he believed in
well yes that's for certain my my mom lives in a small town also and i know you know the funds just aren't available uh to do something in a small town that you have that you can do in a larger town
uh but i think the government is doing a good job so far
from the south especially who come along with a variety of different religious beliefs
oh
um
uh i like a little more indepth coverage and i think that's what you're maybe appealing to you too on something like twenty twenty or forty eight hours
i don't know how many people could live up in space uh for any length of time i mean i
yeah
did you think it was uh the mechanic's problem or uh well with the bolt
uh was a mechanic mechanic's problem he didn't really know what was wrong with it and
for example i have a brother in north carolina and he says the schools there are are incredibly bad um just terrible
well well for one thing there's not enough money in the school system and the money they do have they're not they do not use it wisely uh she my son's teacher has twenty seven students
um she has n- i r- i really don't think she has any paper products in her house um
i think that the trial by jury is better
right they shouldn't allow an appeal
and bu-
and so you know i look at my end of it and things aren't too bad but you know i look at at my father's side of things and they're horrible you know and i hear a lot of horror stories from other people too
[laughter]
yeah hey same here same here yeah w-
um you know you enter a sweepstake in the local department store for a shopping spree or something you put your phone number on there they pass your phone number on to another company
[laughter]
yeah yeah
get a lot quicker in and out
just the pragmatic side of it in terms of how can you afford to raise however many kids one or nine
it's kind of like of like uh a community school i guess where you know all the kids um
so i'm not sure how much i'm getting back but i'm pretty sure should get back a little bit since i'm still a student so not too much
well yeah we have that out here in new york too you know with governor mario king mario and
well around here i it's not too bad because on tuesdays you put out your paper and your cans and and plastic things and they go away so that i mean that's not too tough to put that at the end of your driveway
um-hum
wh- what have you done
oh
yeah boy
mostly a mistake
[noise]
do you think that the weekly magazines provide you with as much detail information as you'd like
yeah good point um i- i think more often should go into you know aids uh education
yeah
yeah
because there was one that it was really handy to have if i absolutely had to have something i could go use it
right
but uh [noise]
yep
yeah i my main concern right now is first of all at this point with the current government and situation i don't see them as any threat
so you don't have to dress very warmly i suppose
no we uh even this this year particular was real warm uh it didn't hardly get cold
[laughter]
yeah that's hard we've
i mean her all her kids are sick but she wasn't home right and her and her her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick
but i don't do that anymore it's just that i guess a habit i've gotten ou- out of and that's uh that's a real good way to get everything recapped
it's not a government it's not the constitution doesn't apply but it
in the past and ended up with not what we expected and having an absolute nightmare especially in dealing with a mail order in trying to return a product and get satisfaction
[noise]
huh
you know rodney got beat up because he he you know he pur- you know he involved himself in some sub self-destructive behavior
against forty other people being
right
[noise]
i learned metrics you know in high school and and before that so i'm familiar with the system i'm still using inches and pounds and the like
i substitute teach and i have kids who talk fresh don't do homework and they say so what's going to happen to me and
um-hum
right
um-hum
strong local national sentiments because they aren't all russians you know they're a lot of enclaves they have other nationalities
yeah
so it's kind of hard to say you know if you're a you know brick layer somebody can
[noise] the only alternative i would see is uh and this would actually be a little more workable since weighing everybody's garbage would be a real pain
in the long run the infrastructure deteriorates and people kind of lose their uh sense of a of purpose
uh my mom had worked for the state and she thought this was a brilliant idea so i just went along with it i thought it'd be neat you know like a james bond woman with a gun and all this and part of the um you know you take this test i did very well and they called me in for a physical
[noise] i've heard people using somebody elses
um-hum
yeah
yeah it was just it it it's just so smooth and yeah nice car
hum are your parents alive
and
yeah
r- yeah right
and the people who are pro-constitution oppose it on the grounds that the government shouldn't even have the right to enforce you to join the military unless the united states is actually under attack
but uh i- i go to the holiday spa here in alexandria and that's pretty good but you know evening time it gets pretty busy
might be too crude to be called woodworking i've built my own deck and
um-hum
huh i huh-uh
right i- i yeah i spent a summer in in in tyler
oh i wasn't there too long ago um
